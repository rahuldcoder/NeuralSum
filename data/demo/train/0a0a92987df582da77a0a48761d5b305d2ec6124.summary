these are the chilling images of an abandoned amusement park that shut down after a boy lost his arm on a ride			1
@entity7 amusement park , @entity8 , @entity9 , closed its doors more than 10 - years ago after a young boy had his arm ripped off on the @entity14 water ride			1
@entity15 , 28 , captured the eerie pictures of the abandoned rides at the fairground where they were left to rust and covered in graffiti			2
he said : ' a boy lost his arm on the nautical jet attraction 14 years ago			1
' after that people started to complain about safety in the park			2
' visitor numbers dwindled and the park closed in 2002 for major renovations , but never reopened			2
' several groups started to try and re-open the park , but their attempts were n't fruitful			0
' there were a lot of plants around because nature had been left to take over			0
nature started to reclaim the park , with all of the attractions still intact , but in disrepair			0
' graffiti artists also claimed some of the walls - one hall was used as an impromptu skate - park			1
' history : the park is believed to have closed after a boy lost his arm on a ride halted : despite the park been closed for many years , many rides are still set up fancy a go on this ? the park has been left in a severe state of decay @entity15 said the amusement park had deteriorated so drastically since being shut down it had to be demolished completely			1
he said : ' up until a couple of years ago , everything was still there - but at this moment , everything has been levelled			1
' weirdly enough , there were still a few people there when i took a look around			0
' while it sometimes is completely locked down , the gates were wide open when i arrived			0
passage through : most of the rides have now been covered by overgrown trees and bushes is it art ? the abandoned amusement park has been taken over by graffiti @entity82 but not with envy : a thick swamp is in place where a water ride will have been ' a few locals were walking their dog in the park and other urban explorers were wandering around			1
' i 've been in several abandoned places during my lifetime			0
i 've also been to theme parks such as @entity95 when only a few hundred guests have been present			0
' it 's only then that you can truly appreciate the beauty of the minds behind these amusement parks - trying to tell a story			0
' fancy this ? a chilling welcome awaits any visitors today to the @entity7 not a pretty picture : all that remains of the amusement park is derelict buildings and memories .			2

@entity7 in @entity9 was closed more than 10 years ago
believed a child losing his arm on a ride was one of the main reasons for it closing
many rides still remain , adding to a chilling *environment*
graffiti ' artists ' have taken over *wasteland*
