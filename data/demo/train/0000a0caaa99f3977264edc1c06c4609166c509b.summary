by @entity0 published : 15:33 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 06:01 est , 14 november 2012 a failed asylum - seeker was handed thousands of pounds in compensation yesterday by @entity4 judges who claimed @entity6 law had failed to protect her from being treated as a slave			1
the @entity10 came to @entity6 illegally on a false passport , became a care worker and was free to leave the house where she worked , the @entity9 heard			1
police investigating the 33 - year - old 's case decided she was a criminal and a @entity6 judge cast doubt on her credibility , describing her story as ' implausible '			1
controversial : an illegal immigrant was today handed thousands of pounds in compensation by @entity4 human rights judges on the grounds that @entity6 law failed to protect her from slavery			1
the @entity9 is pictured but the @entity30 judges ruled that the woman , whose identity they shielded , suffered a breach of her rights as there was no @entity6 law at the time specifically banning slavery			1
they ordered the government to pay her £ 23,500 , made up of £ 7,000 in compensation and £ 16,500 in expenses and costs			0
the judgment marks another case in which @entity6 has been told that acts of parliament and common law have been inadequate to meet @entity4 demands			1
since then , the @entity47 has been passed which specifically outlaws slavery			0
however , prime minister @entity49 remains at odds with @entity30 over the human rights judges ' demand that @entity6 allows convicted prisoners to vote			1
the woman in the slavery case – identified only as @entity56 – came to this country in 2002 on a false passport and visa provided by her uncle , identified only as @entity61 he set her up as a care worker for an @entity65 couple in @entity66 and £ 1,600 a month was paid for the work			0
but , the woman alleged , the money was given to her uncle and she was never paid more than £ 20 or £ 40 when she was given an afternoon off each month			0
frustration : @entity49 remains at odds with @entity30 over the human rights judges ' demand that @entity6 pass laws to allow convicted prisoners to vote in elections she did not complain until 2006 , four years later , when she collapsed in a bank and was treated in hospital after it was discovered she was @entity76 positive			1
@entity56 was given a flat by her local council , but her application for asylum , on the grounds she had fled sexual and physical violence in @entity10 , failed			0
police investigations ended in 2009 following two inquiries into the woman 's complaints that she was held as a slave			0
a report from the @entity90 noted that she had been refused legitimate entry into @entity6 and had come in with a false passport and forged visa			2
the woman had been paid through her relative ' in order to hide from the authorities the fact that the victim did not have a national insurance number '			0
the report went on : ' if money was paid to her , then she would have had to pay tax and her false identity would have come to the notice of the tax office			0
this would then lead to her arrest and eviction from the @entity6			2
' there is no evidence to show that this female is a victim of slavery or forced labour			2
she willingly worked and was paid but she chose that the money should go to her uncle to conceal being in the @entity6			2
it is basically a situation that one criminal , her uncle , has taken all the proceeds of their crime			0
' the @entity6 judge who heard @entity56 's asylum appeal ' expressed serious concerns about the applicant 's credibility and found much of her account to be implausible ' , the @entity30 court heard			1
but the @entity4 judges said that , because police investigated the complaints , they could not have been considered implausible			2
they insisted that the woman 's complaints were credible			0
the court added that the inquiry should not have been carried out by a police unit dealing with human trafficking rather than slavery			2
@entity6 was also obliged to prosecute any act aimed at enforcing slavery			1
the country 's law was ' inadequate ' for the purpose , the @entity4 judges declared .			0

an investigation by police officers found she was not a victim of slavery and was a criminal
a @entity6 judge also cast doubt on her credibility and described her story as *‘* implausible *’*
