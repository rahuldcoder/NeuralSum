they eat three full meals a day , drink from a cup , they 've grown teeth and can walk and talk , but these three - year - old triplets are still breastfed by their mother once or twice a day			1
@entity7 , 45 , has been breastfeeding her triplets - @entity9 - since they were born and will continue as long as she is physically capable			1
ms @entity7 , who lives in @entity10 with her husband @entity11 , was doing 30 - 40 feeds a day when their two daughters and son were first born but has since scaled back to just morning and night			1
' at three years old they are basically just fed to sleep , not that they actually fall asleep , it 's more like ' fed to calm / sleepy '			0
' in reality it is only about 10 - 15 minutes of their day , their hectic , chaotic , loud , busy , competitive , triplet day , where they get to sit quietly by themselves with mummy			2
' ms @entity7 also breastfeeds first thing in the morning and she says the three toddlers are highly competitive as they fuss over who has to wait to be nursed			1
' my kids walk and talk and eat solid food and drink from a cup and are independent and have a full set of teeth ... all the things that people point out as reasons for weaning , but in actuality a child can do all these things and still be breastfed , ' she said			0
ms @entity7 says her triplets eat solid food and have a full set of teeth but she still breastfeeds morning and night to spend one - on - one time with each of her children the three toddlers can be highly competitive as they fuss over who waits to be nursed , according to ms @entity7 ' i think the weaning down of feeds during the day was partly because we got so busy â€¦ there was play and stimulation and they just asked for it less			1
' i really only say no to them now ... when we are out in public			0
i say that we will wait until we are home for that now , simply because i am aware of how many eyes are on us			0
' the @entity70 , who lived in @entity72 when the triplets were born , tried several plans before finally working out how to breastfeed three hungry mouths and still manage to sleep			2
' we finally settled on ( @entity11 ) sleeping in the nursery with the two girls and bottle feeding them my breast milk at night , ' she said			2
' i would sleep in our bedroom with the third one and breastfeed him			0
then after every feed i would pump the breast milk , which became the next nights feeding for the girls			0
@entity7 and her husband @entity11 gave birth to triplets after two rounds of @entity93 when they lived in @entity72 ' as they got older they got much quicker at feeding and instead of 30 - 40 minutes , they would be done in 15 - 20 , and then as they got older it still only takes 10 minutes			1
' ms @entity7 , who has two adult daughters from her first marriage , breastfed them until they self - weaned at 13 months			1
' i set myself the goal of two years with the triplets , not fully sure that we would get that far , and definitely not thinking we would still be going at three years old , ' she said			0
' but they are still happy with it and i am still happy with it and it works for our family so we keep going			0
ms @entity7 used to feed 30 - 40 times a day when the triplets were newborns			1
but she has since cut scaled back to just twice a day ms @entity7 says a breastfeeding relationship is between a mother and child and they are the only people who should have a say in how long it continues ' it has been everything to their lives , it has slowly changed to being a very small part of their lives , and one day it will be a distant memory in their lives			1
' a breastfeeding relationship is between a mother and child and they are the only people who should have a say in how long it continues			2
the beauty being that every mother gets to decide for herself			0
' ' i know that extended , or natural - term breastfeeding is n't for everyone , and that is okay			2
i would say to people if it 's not for you then do n't do it , simple as that			0
