by @entity0 published : 19:58 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 11:01 est , 7 march 2013 @entity2 's influence is increasing to such a degree that some are suggesting she and husband @entity5 be given a title with the words ‘ i ’ll take the teddy for my dau			1
’ during a walkabout in @entity12 on tuesday , the @entity10 perhaps let slip what the world has been waiting to know — the gender of the royal baby			1
is she expecting a girl ? certainly , she is pregnant enough to know one way or the other			1
as the @entity20 has announced that the baby is due in july , @entity10 must be at least 23 weeks pregnant			1
an ultrasound between 18 and 22 weeks can reveal the sex for those who want to be told			2
some tests — amniocentesis , for example , which screens for @entity29 ’s syndrome — can provide an answer at 15 weeks			2
either way , when the @entity10 laughingly protested ‘ we ’re not telling ! ’ to one of the @entity12 well - wishers who suggested that she knew whether she was expecting a boy or a girl , it was surely a hint that she definitely knows			2
should we see any pink paint being smuggled into @entity40 , @entity41 , which is currently being refurbished , we wo n’t be surprised			2
the prospect of a little princess increases the already strong chances that this baby will be brought up royal , but essentially a @entity2			1
some royal watchers think @entity48 has become one			1
as a first granddaughter naturally gravitates towards her maternal grandmother , and @entity2 has raised two daughters ( in a highly dedicated fashion ) and @entity56 none , this naturally strengthens her position even further			1
at some stage , @entity2 will effectively become the queen mother anyway			1
indeed , her influence is increasing to such a degree that some are suggesting she ( and husband @entity5 ) be given a title			1
of course , the @entity65 will take an active interest in her new heir or heiress			2
so there will be no shortage of strong female role models for the little princess			2
the name game the smart money is on @entity74 , a nod to the @entity65 , and both @entity2 and @entity10 ’s middle name			1
contenders for the middle name are @entity2 , @entity79 , or @entity80 — @entity79 ’s middle name , after her mother			1
although @entity84 and @entity85 have wangled themselves in front of @entity10 in the royal pecking order , they will have to curtsey to @entity10 and @entity48 ’s child			1
there ’s no way round that one , girls			2
if the @entity10 does have a girl , she might name her @entity74 , as a nod to the @entity65			2
it is also both @entity2 and @entity10 's middle name timeless toys there would be minimal pink plastic for a princess			1
this is where a royal girl would come into her own : perhaps she alone would be allowed to play with @entity107 ’s @entity106 ’ @entity108 , the exquisite mini-palace at @entity110 , which was designed by architect sir @entity111			1
or ‘ @entity112 ’ and @entity113 ’ , the blonde and brunette dolls presented by the @entity112 to the @entity65 and her sister @entity116 in 1938 , who came with a 360 - piece trousseau , including cases by @entity120 , handbags by @entity122 and @entity124 jewellery			2
then there is ‘ @entity126 ’ or @entity127 , a straw thatched cottage given to the @entity65 and princess @entity116 by the people of @entity130 in 1932			2
it is in the garden of the @entity134 ’s house , @entity135 , at @entity110 , and is the perfect spot for playing with elegant little tea sets on summer days			2
@entity138 @entity139 of @entity140 could have let slip what the world has been waiting to know during a walkabout in @entity12 there ’s no word on whether @entity10 will have a maternity nurse — if she does , she had better get them to sign a confidentiality agreement because they are usually terrible gossips			1
there has been talk of her not having her nanny			0
she may go down the fashionable route ( like @entity156 and many others ) of having a housekeeper who does childcare duties			0
this allows the mother rather smugly to say at trendy @entity163 supper parties : ‘ i do n’t have a nanny			1
’ if @entity10 does employ one , a girl will perhaps require a less boisterous type than @entity48 and @entity168 ’s former companion @entity167 , who loved to romp around with the small princes			0
those discreet sorts at the leading firms , @entity172 and @entity173 , will be waiting for the call			0
which school ? all the nearest nursery schools , including the @entity177 in @entity178 , a short walk across @entity180 , are co- ed. there are several girls ’ schools close by , too — @entity185 , sister school of @entity187 ( prince @entity48 ’s alma mater ) , and @entity189 in @entity190			0
but given how much @entity10 hated all - girls ’ @entity108 and loved mixed @entity192 , perhaps she will favour co- ed. in which case she might choose between @entity194 on @entity195 , famous for its emphasis on manners as well as academics , or the more theatrical @entity199 ’s in @entity190			0
other parents at these bastions of privilege will include the @entity204 upper middle classes and the international super-rich , keen to give their children an @entity204 education — and befriend our future monarch			0
whichever establishment @entity10 chooses can probably get away with doubling the fees the moment the news leaks , given that there is talk of the socially aspirational who live close to @entity40 timing their pregnancies as close to @entity10 ’s as possible			0
baby fashion move over , @entity219			1
with a mother who can make wellies sell by the shopload when she pulls them on , the marketing power of a princess would be boundless			1
a july tot can cool off in frothy dresses with matching pants to cover her nappy			0
first port of call — though packages will probably arrive without asking — would be the @entity234 shop a short pram ride away			0
princess @entity234 of @entity236 designs some of the prettiest girls ’ clothes in @entity163 , and @entity48 is godfather to one of her children , @entity56 another			0
these days , a @entity241 with angel wings is a must			0
for later on , a floaty ‘ princess ’ dress is £ 220			0
a princess would have no shortage of strong female role models otherwise there is @entity250 in @entity251 — as well as @entity253 ’s fashionable ‘ @entity252 ’			0
who did they have in mind when they designed a mauve ‘ @entity259 ’ baby dress at £ 46 ? as this would be the only girl in @entity264 who does n’t need to indulge a @entity245 fantasy , we may well see tasteful restraint			1
the heir 's hair @entity268 could have plenty of advice for any princess parties roving hairdresser @entity272 cut @entity48 ’s and @entity168 ’s hair when they were boys and went on the @entity276 tour last year with @entity10			0
she could do mother and daughter at the same time			1
a bling bed it must be the most regal @entity282 basket in the world			0
furniture shop for @entity286 rich kids , @entity287 of @entity288 , makes one called the ‘ @entity289 ’ which has hand - cut glass crystals and @entity112 chantilly lace draping down from the basket			0
the hood can be made with a coronet on it ( a snip at £ 5,995 )			0
well , a princess can hardly sleep in one from @entity297			0
princess parties these will be the most sought - after invitations — on the junior @entity163 circuit , anyway			0
but granny @entity2 and @entity302 will come into their own			1
‘ celebrate with a cake ’ , as @entity302 might have written in her book			0
the @entity307 ’ firm @entity306 provides ‘ @entity316 ’ and ‘ 1st @entity245 ’ ranges of paper plates , cups , banners and other party goods — but that might be a touch naff in the circumstances			0
p.s. of course , there is always the possibility that when the @entity10 said ‘ i ’ll take the teddy for my dau			0
’ she was about to say ‘ dog ’ , or ‘ darling son ’ , or even ‘ delinquent husband			1
