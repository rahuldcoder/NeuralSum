by @entity1 correspondent published : 18:19 est , 4 april 2012 updated : 03:04 est , 5 april 2012 the price of burgers , sausages and pies is to rocket because of an @entity8 ban on low - quality meat			1
from the end of this month , there will be a ban on bulking up fast food and supermarket value ranges with reconstituted mince made from scraps of beef and lamb			1
the move will hit the shopping budget of already hard - pressed families and lead to more meat being wasted in abattoirs			1
endangered : an @entity8 ban on low - quality meat could spell the end for the cheap hamburger the @entity28 , which risked a ban on the export of @entity32 meat products if it did not impose the @entity34 - driven ruling , stressed that the change is not being made because of health or safety issues			1
instead , it is the result of a disagreement over the definition of the so - called ‘ desinewed meat ’			2
but the meat - processing industry accused the @entity28 of ‘ bowing down ’ to the @entity43 and warned of price rises and job losses			1
health drive : @entity48 's campaign for junk food to be banned from school canteens means desinewed meat features less in school dinners @entity53 , director of the @entity54 , said : ‘ this is a criminal waste of a valuable food product at a time when we are being urged to reduce food wastage			1
common sense has gone out of the window			0
‘ if economic principles apply , the cost of the burger will rise and it is going to be the less well - off who are affected at what is already a bad time			0
’ the row surrounds desinewed meat , or @entity71			2
this is meat that is left on bones and carcasses after slaughter			2
rather than going to waste , it is grated off mechanically , creating a mince - like substance			2
@entity48 ’s high - profile campaign for junk food to be banned from school canteens means @entity71 features less in school dinners than in the past			2
but it is widely found in inexpensive meat products on sale in fast food restaurants and in supermarkets , where it is used to bulk up the meat content at low cost			1
the @entity28 sees @entity71 as being a different product to a second type of reconstituted meat , called mechanically separated meat , or @entity96			1
the higher pressures used in the @entity96 process means that while it is considered acceptable for chicken and pork , it is not deemed usable for beef and lamb , for fear of spreading diseases such as @entity105 , the @entity43 says @entity71 and @entity96 are one and the same			0
under this interpretation of the law , it will no longer be possible to put beef or lamb through even the gentler dsm processing			0
existing products will not be recalled but any foods that contain reconstituted beef or lamb will have to be reformulated			1
the cheap desinewed meat in burgers will have to be replaced with more expensive cuts			2
chicken and pork carcasses can still undergo @entity71 processing but any foods they are put into will have to be clearly labelled			0
currently , @entity71 ’s classification as meat means it counts towards the total meat content of a product and does not need to be listed separately on the label			0
there are fears that the changes will push up the cost of some meat products so much that shoppers stop buying them , leading to job losses in @entity32 ’s £ 6billion meat industry			1
the @entity54 estimates that the total cost to the consumer and industry of the moratorium could reach £ 200million			0
describing the ban as ‘ madness ’ , mr @entity53 said : ‘ all this has happened at breakneck speed			0
the industry must be given time to adjust to any change in requirements and market circumstances in a controlled and properly managed way , in order to minimise market disruption and financial damage			0
‘ people are going to have to reformulate products , repackage and relabel			0
i do n’t know that you wo n’t see an @entity156 sausage any more but it may be that it ’s more expensive			0
’ the @entity28 said that if the dispute over classification can be resolved , the ban could be lifted			1
its chief executive , @entity161 , said the move had come ‘ unexpectedly ’			0
the @entity163 said it supports ‘ a pragmatic approach to the required changes , including a reasonable timeframe for the transition , to avoid disproportionate measures that could lead to meat being wasted , causing a significant impact on the environment and on the price and availability of meat raw material ’			0
a spokesman for the consumer watchdog which ? said that its research showed that shoppers want to know if they are eating desinewed meat and that clear labelling of food allows customers to make an informed choice .			1
