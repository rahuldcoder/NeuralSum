" the worst part is the helplessness , " said @entity72 , whose son also witnessed the shooting			0
" you want to take that pain away			0
you want to be able to take those nightmares away , but you ca n't			1
" the gunman , @entity80 , who killed 20 children and six educators at the school , shot his way into the building the morning of dec. 14			1
as the sound of gunfire and shells hitting the floor rang out from the hallway , the children in @entity88 's class were moved to the back of their room			1
they were sitting on the floor when @entity80 burst through the door			1
no one spoke , not even @entity80			0
the gunman pointed his gun at the face of @entity4 's son , just inches away			0

" people do n't hurt @entity166			1
" @entity72 said his son , who is in therapy , has had to cope with vivid nightmares			1

" he knows they 're there			0

the families of the 26 people who were killed each received $ 281,000			1
in a letter to the foundation in charge of distributing the donations , @entity189 said $ 20,000 is not nearly adequate for the families of the survivors , who are likely to need counseling for years			1
" twenty thousand dollars will be insufficient to address the wide range of mental health needs for these youngsters and their siblings and parents for years into the future , " @entity189 wrote in the aug. 7 letter urging the foundation to set aside money for the families ' future needs			1
