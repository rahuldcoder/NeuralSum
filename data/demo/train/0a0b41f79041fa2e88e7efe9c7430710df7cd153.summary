@entity218 , prosecuting , said : ' there must have been considerable involvement to deal with these very large quantities of drugs			0
there was evidence of high living and there must be considerable sums of money still concealed to this day			0
' the conspiracy was run by @entity230 , known to some within his organisation as " @entity233 "			0
he employed a variety of tactics to keep his actions hidden from the police , such as the use of more than 10 " dirty phones " during the course of a year , couriers to transport his drugs and safe houses for the mixing , re-packaging and storage of drugs			0
base : the drugs ring operated out of the leafy spa town of @entity13 , @entity14 ' he and his partner , @entity7 , lived well on the proceeds of his drug - dealing organisation			1
whilst on benefits or without any legitimate income they spent thousands of pounds on foreign holidays , vehicles and expensive living , mainly dealing in cash in an attempt to stay under the radar of the authorities			0
' mitigating , @entity7 ’s lawyer @entity264 said : ' she will miss being a mother in those wonderful early years of raising a child			2
she entered into this with a degree of naivity and was under the influence of others due to her relationship with someone with more criminal experience			0
' @entity42 ’s lawyer @entity275 said : ' it is clear that her husband , @entity42 , brought the drugs into her home and her life			2
there was no high living , she was naïve and did n’t know the value of the drugs or the drug chain			0
she has been ostracised by her family and is scared to go to prison			0
' after the hearing , det insp @entity288 , of @entity54 ’s organised crime unit , said each member of the gang played a part in the operation			0
' @entity230 was undoubtedly the main man at the head of the operation and went to great lengths to ensure that he had little contact with the drugs , instead getting other people to store , cut , and courier the drugs for him , ' he said			1
' he also reaped the benefits of the conspiracy enjoying expensive foreign holidays and buying cars , which he paid for in cash			0
' but every member of this gang played a significant part in the conspiracy and their involvement in this organised crime group can not be underestimated either			0
without their commitment to bulking out the drugs to enhance @entity93 ’s profits and their willingness to use their own homes and businesses to stash the supplies the conspiracy would n’t have continued for as long as it did			0
