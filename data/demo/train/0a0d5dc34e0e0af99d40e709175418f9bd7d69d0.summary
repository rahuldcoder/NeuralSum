by @entity0 published : 17:55 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 03:34 est , 24 november 2012 the evidence of a psychiatrist accused of distorting reports to suit the needs of local authorities is still being used to remove children from their parents			2
one mother faced the prospect of having a baby son taken away from her because of a report written by dr @entity13 six years ago – before the child in question was even born			2
the doctor is at the centre of an investigation over claims that he falsely diagnosed parents with mental disorders to fit with the view of social services			1
dr @entity13 , facing clams he deliberately misdiagnosed patients he has already offered to surrender his doctor 's licence following the claims – but has been told the allegations are so serious he must face a public hearing			1
now the @entity31 has learned that his reports – for which he has been paid millions by local authorities – are still being used in the secret family courts against parents he labelled ' unfit '			1
one woman , who can be named only as miss c , had her two daughters taken away after she failed one of dr @entity13 's controversial ' parenting assessments ' in 2006			1
in a bizarre report , he criticised miss c for speaking to her elder daughter ' in an over-bright tone ' , vacuuming the floor ' in an agitated way ' and even on one occasion , for ' overcooking the pasta '			0
he also expressed concern that her youngest daughter , who was just two months old , spent too much time ' asleep , wrapped in blankets '			0
claims have been made by a woman known as @entity56 b , about how her daughter , now six , was taken away from her mother due to a report by psychiatrist dr @entity13 he concluded she was ' unable to protect the children from harm ' because she was ' preoccupied ' by what other people thought of her			1
as a result of the report , the mother was forced to endure the agony of having her two children taken away – and placed in the care of her abusive ex-partner			0
' i could n't believe it , ' she said			0
' they are everything to me			0
to have them taken away was awful for me but much worse for them			0
my eldest daughter was utterly traumatised			0
' determined to get her daughters back , @entity80 fought a long legal battle and eventually won the right to care for her two daughters unsupervised for one day a week			0
when she gave birth to another baby earlier this year , a parenting assessment found ' no concerns ' about @entity80 's ability to look after the child , who was ' happy ' and ' contented ' in her care			0
but despite this , her local authority started proceedings to have the boy removed and adopted – citing dr @entity13 's six - year - old report on her parenting capabilities as evidence she was an unfit mother			1
' it was like being in a nightmare ' she said			0
' everybody knows i 'm a good mother			0
but dr @entity13 's report is like a black cloud hanging over everything			1
it just seems so wrong that they could still have used his reports in court to take my baby away , even though he 's being investigated and all these people have come forward			2
' the @entity117 is investigating a string of claims by women who say their children were wrongly removed as a result of dr @entity13 's reports			1
at least one former member of staff at his assessment centre – @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity129 – is understood to have come forward in support of the parents			2
earlier this year , dr @entity13 , an eminent psychiatrist who has lectured at @entity132 and advised mps on the family courts , offered to surrender his doctor 's licence after being confronted with allegations that he had deliberately misdiagnosed patients with mental disorders			1
but the @entity117 dismissed his request and has said it expects to hold a fitness to @entity142 early next year			2
dr @entity13 is now seeking permission of the @entity144 to challenge the @entity117 's decision to investigate one complaint that falls outside the usual five - year time limit for investigations			1
meanwhile a number of women have contacted a solicitors ' firm in @entity153 regarding civil claims against the psychiatrist			1
in a statement , dr @entity13 said : ' i have had one complaint referred to the @entity117 's @entity158 for a hearing , a complaint that relates to a case in 2007 , but no hearing date has yet been fixed			1
' there are other complaints that the @entity117 are investigating but their investigations in these other cases are at a preliminary stage and none of them has been referred to the @entity117 's @entity158			2
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
