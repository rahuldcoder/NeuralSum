women are more likely than men to blame their partner for failings in their relationship , according to a new study			1
researchers also found people who are unhappy in their romantic relationship spend more time during a disagreement thinking about how angry and frustrated they are , while happy couples coordinate their thoughts so that when one partner has many emotional thoughts , the other has few			1
lead investigator doctor @entity15 , professor of communication at the @entity17 , said : ' among happy couples , when one partner is thinking a lot about disagreement or anger , the other instead may be thinking about how to understand his or her partner or how to resolve the conflict			1
' a new study found that women are the ones who pass the blame to their husbands when it comes to arguments ( and most are about money and past relationships ) she said the findings show that people 's thoughts during a conflict situation reflect and shape their own relationship satisfaction and can even affect how happy their partner is			1
dr @entity15 and her colleagues studied 71 young unmarried heterosexual couples in @entity43 , who had been together an average of three years			2
each person was encouraged to privately express his or her thoughts aloud to a researcher while in a separate room from the other partner and while communicating about a topic of conflict with the partner via a computer chat programme			2
the chat programme showed the person 's typed messages in one section and the partner 's replies and messages in another section , but did not display the person 's vocalised thoughts , which were tape recorded			0
the researchers found that during a discussion involving conflict with a romantic partner , when one person thinks about making excuses or denying his or her role in the conflict , the other partner was likelier to be unhappy in the relationship in most cases , the couples discussed a topic of disagreement that both participants had listed in a questionnaire about conflict issues			1
before the study , they also completed a questionnaire about their relationship satisfaction			2
topics of conflict included amount of time spent together , money , past dating relationships , alcohol use , and friends and relatives who disapproved of their relationship			1
the researchers told the couples they had 10 minutes to discuss the topic and come to a resolution			1
a researcher sat behind the participant in each room and reminded that study subject to voice his or her thoughts throughout the interaction			2
the researchers found that during a discussion involving conflict with a romantic partner , when one person thinks about making excuses or denying his or her role in the conflict , the other partner was likelier to be unhappy in the relationship than those whose partner did not ' stonewall			1
' people in unhappy relationships were more likely to be inflexible in their thinking and more interested in changing the subject of discussion			0
they also thought more about how repetitive the discussion felt			0
when both people in the relationship were dissatisfied , they were more likely to think about the power they had or their partner had in the relationship			0
they also were more likely to focus their thoughts on disagreement or emotions , such as anger and frustration , at the same time as their partner			0
doctor @entity15 said : ' we do n't have data on what happens when partners change their thoughts , but our findings certainly do suggest that thinking about how angry and frustrated you are - or thinking about how much power is being wielded during a conflict - is not beneficial for the relationship			0
' she speculated that people 's thoughts might affect their partner 's relationship satisfaction because they often voice their thoughts to their partner or , in a real - life setting , they send non-verbal messages			0
when both people in the relationship were dissatisfied , they were more likely to think about the power they had or their partner had in the relationship unlike other studies , which found differences between men 's and women 's thoughts during disagreement , the current study found only one statistically significant sex - based difference in thoughts : women were more likely than men to blame their partner			1
dr @entity15 added : ' the results raise questions about widely accepted differences between women 's and men 's cognitions			2
' however , she warned that computer - aided interactions are not the same as face - to - face conversations because they do not give participants access to each other 's expressions or tone of voice			0
the researchers concluded that participants ' thoughts may therefore differ from those they might have during a face - to - face conflict			0
the findings were published online in the journal @entity190 .			0
