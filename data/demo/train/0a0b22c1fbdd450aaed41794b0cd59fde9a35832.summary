ministers want to put calls by the emergency services on commercial mobile phone networks ( file picture ) officials say emergency workers will receive faster internet connections to download data available using the latest smartphones			2
but critics are concerned that moving the emergency services on to the commercial network – largely untested in major emergencies – increases the risk of call blackouts			1
they say that during the 2011 riots and the @entity47 bombings in 2005 , mobile services across the capital crashed under the sheer volume of use			0
currently , emergency services have their own masts so even when commercial networks collapse their calls can continue			2
inspector @entity54 , of the @entity55 , which represents rank - and - file officers , said : ‘ there are two major issues which are still of concern			0
' how the transition to the new network will take place and be managed , and what provision has been made to ensure the emergency services are prioritised during periods of heavy user traffic and events			2
the @entity18 insists 999 crews will have priority over other phone users on the system ( file picture ) ‘ @entity72 and officer safety must remain the priority for any advancements and changes to the emergency service network			1

delivery of a solution that simply results in lower cost for @entity5 without fully considering the effectiveness and ongoing efficiency for individual services could have significant implications for public and fire - fighter safety			0
’ the @entity18 insists the consortium which wins the contract , worth more than £ 400million a year , will be ordered to prioritise the police , fire and ambulance services in an emergency			0
@entity102 , chief executive of @entity103 , whose firm was not shortlisted by the @entity18 , said : ‘ people ’s lives will be put at risk by the government ’s plan to put calls by the emergency services on commercial mobile phone networks			1
‘ the system simply can not cope with a major incident			0
