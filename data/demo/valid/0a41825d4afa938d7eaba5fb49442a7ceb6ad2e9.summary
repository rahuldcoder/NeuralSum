@entity0 has complained about the ' buggeration factor ' of trying to push policies through @entity3			1
the prime minister used the colourful phrase as he expressed frustration with the civil service 's processes of consultations and reviews			1
the word buggeration is defined by the @entity12 as a term ' used to describe a feeling of absolute c * * * but with a hint of light - hearted optimism '			2
mr @entity0 's remarks echoed @entity20 's famous phrase about the ' scars on my back ' when he spoke about the difficulties of @entity25 and education reform			1
in an interview with the @entity33 , the prime minister insisted the @entity34 needed another term in power to restore the country 's economic fortunes			1
' the first thing is finish the job , ' he said			0
' with a five per cent budget deficit and still too many people unemployed , with growth that has n't worked its way through so everyone feels the benefits , the job is n't done			0
' the ambition is for @entity49 to be the best place in @entity51 to start , grow and run a business , schools where we are not lagging in the tables but we 're absolutely busting through the top , a welfare system where it pays to work , where you 're always better off in work			0
' and from this a sense that the values of the country will have changed to be ones where people feel deep national pride			2
' mr @entity0 said @entity68 , the former chancellor of the exchequer , was crucial in maintaining @entity71 support for austerity measures over the last five years			1
' he sat round the cabinet table and said , look , this is going to take longer than you think , stick with it â€” there 's no alternative package			2
' apart from presiding over a recovery led by the private sector mr @entity0 says he hoped to be remembered as the prime minister who resolved two key questions facing @entity49			1
history : the @entity85 's remarks echoed @entity20 's famous ' scars on my back ' phrase about difficulties of @entity25 and education reform but mr @entity0 said that sounded ' a bit @entity31 ' ' one is , does the @entity49 want to stay together ? yes			1
secondly , does the @entity49 want to stay in a reformed @entity93 ? yes , ' he said			0
mr @entity0 said his pledge to hold an @entity93 referendum would mar ' the moment when @entity49 stops sleepwalking towards the exit '			1
' i think that 's what 's happening now			0
the @entity49 public can see what 's happening : @entity51 is changing before their eyes and they have n't been asked about it , ' he said			0
he conceded some conservatives would ' vote to leave altogether ' whatever deal he strikes with @entity111 on a looser , more trade - based relationship			0
but he added : ' i think there can be a coming together after that			0
' mr @entity0 sought to dismiss speculation that if reelected , he intends to stand down in 2018 after holding the referendum			2
' i 'm standing for a full term and that is what i want to serve , ' he said .			0
