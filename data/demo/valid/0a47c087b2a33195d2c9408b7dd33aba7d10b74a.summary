@entity0 have another reason to be steamed about this winter of epic snow : the city is starting to remove the lawn chairs , milk crates , coolers and other stuff that people put on the street to reserve the parking spaces they 've dug out			1
garbage haulers began collecting the ' space savers ' monday after mayor @entity14 declared an end to the longstanding practice — at least until the next major storm			1
@entity18 has been slammed with more than 8 1/2 feet of snow this season , including about 3 inches sunday night , and more is on the way later this week			2

officials typically turn a blind eye to the lawn chairs , orange cones and assorted @entity52 use to reserve a parking space after clearing it of snow in @entity18 , the working - class neighborhood where the wintertime battles over parking spots are legendary , some complained the ban on space savers is coming too soon			1
@entity18 residents fear the nasty parking disputes that have pitted neighbor against neighbor will only get worse			0
' some people think they own these spots , ' said @entity68 , who keeps her family 's two spots reserved with traffic cones			0
in tightly packed @entity18 neighborhoods — and , for that matter , in other snowy cities where parking on the street is a problem even in the best of circumstances — homeowners use space savers to enforce the unwritten rule of the urban jungle : if you shoveled it out , it 's yours			1
drivers who violate space - saver etiquette risk returning to find hostile notes on their windshields , fresh snow piled on their cars , and even smashed windows , keyed doors and flattened tires			1
above , some of the more humorous parking savers seen on the streets of @entity18 in the recent snowfall residents have been defacing and vandalizing cars that take their coveted , dug out spots typical space savers include orange traffic cones , beat - up lawn chairs , coolers and garbage cans			1
stuffed animals , dolls and a tattered golf bag were among the more colorful items left on @entity18 streets this winter			0
a recycling - truck operator in @entity115 who would identify himself only as @entity117 said he recently saw a toilet bowl holding down a parking spot			1
this winter , he added , seems to have brought out more threatening messages than years past			0
a traffic cone bore this message : ' i am a resident and if you value your car , do n't take my space			0
' in general , space savers are allowed on @entity18 streets up to 48 hours after a storm			2
but many of the objects have been out at the curb for more than a month because city officials largely turned a blind eye to the practice as storm after storm hit @entity18			2

' it 's stupid that you can claim spots in the first place , ' @entity167 said			0
' it should be a free - for - all			0
' in the city 's @entity115 section , some placed the blame squarely on the city			0
' if we had better snow removal , then we would have no a need for space savers , ' said the rev. @entity187 , a pastor at the @entity188			2
' the people have a responsibility to be neighborly , but the city also has a responsibility to create an environment where they can be neighborly			0

above , a walker and cane hold a spot in @entity18 in @entity206 , where residents similarly use shopping carts and other objects to protect shoveled - out parking spaces , the police department regularly tweets humorous warnings against the illegal custom under the hashtag ' @entity213			1
' one , featuring a picture of @entity216 from the @entity218 movie ' @entity219 ' holding an orange traffic cone , urged residents upset about people parking in their spots to ' let it go			0
' ' we have a long winter ahead of us , and we 're prepared to put out as many ridiculously bad memes as necessary to get folks to shovel and share , ' the department said in a @entity231 post			0
@entity232 , a @entity18 suburb , does n't allow space savers either , and residents have been putting up signs this winter to remind neighbors that they do n't tolerate the bare - knuckle tactics parts of @entity18 are notorious for			2
' how should we be behaving ? @entity239 , level - headed adults , ' the bright green signs read			0
' so should we be slashing tires ? @entity242 and should we be bashing in windshields ? no. '			0

@entity52 have been saving parking spaces they 've dug out with milk crates , coolers , lawn chairs and other objects
the savers are *predominant* in already - packed neighborhoods that have been having a hard time digging out of a historic amount of snow
however , garbage collectors have started picking up the savers since the city says they are not allowed
