a woman who hated her nose for ' as long as she can remember ' was finally spurred on to go under the knife after a total stranger told her she 'd be more beautiful if her feature was made smaller			1
speaking about her nose , @entity5 , 26 , from @entity6 , told @entity7 : ' everyone has body hang - ups growing up			1
like all teenage girls , i had plenty			0
but while i grew out of some of the others and became generally happy with my overall appearance , my nose just seemed to get worse with age			1
and given that it ’s right in the centre of your face , it ’s not something you can hide away			0
' @entity5 felt that her feature was too large for her face and never felt able to wear her hair up because she was convinced that her nose dominated her face			1
@entity5 , 26 , always felt insecure about her nose , left , and was spurred into researching rhinoplasty after a drunk stranger on a train told her that her nose was ' huge '			1
she is thrilled with the results , right , and believes the confidence boost has helped her land her dream job more than the physical impact , was the emotional she experienced			1
she said : ' i was unhappy with my appearance , and this showed			0
i could spend ages doing my hair and make - up , but i could n’t change my nose , i could n’t hide it			1
' i ’d never catch a glimpse of myself and smile , no matter how long i spent trying to make myself look good , because my nose dominated and overshadowed everything			1
' it was n't until a complete stranger criticised her nose that she decided to do something about it			1
@entity5 says she is ' so glad ' she took the plunge and had the surgery done			1
she applied for a graduate project manager role in construction prior to the procedure , and secured the position post procedure @entity5 says she has achieved what she set out to do and finally feels her facial features are all in proportion @entity5 said that before she made the change , pictured , no matter how long she spent trying to make herself look good , she could n't because she felt that her nose dominated and overshadowed everything else ' i was on a train into @entity62 to meet friends that she when i noticed a drunk man making his way towards me , ' she explained			1
' i hate situations like that , and tried to shrink into my chair but he was making a beeline for me			0
the man sat opposite me , and said : " wow , you are really beautiful			1
it 's huge ! " ' i felt like the whole train was watching me as i tried to laugh it off while dying inside from embarrassment			2
but , finally , someone had said it			0
i was n't being paranoid , it was huge			0
and i needed to hear it			0
' @entity5 said that she finally felt as though she could explore cosmetic surgery with a legitimate reason and it was n't all in her head			1
but while she admits the stranger 's comment did spur her into looking into getting rhinoplasty , this was n’t the reason she had the surgery done			2
for years , @entity5 had avoided having photos sideways on and it was n't until a drunk man on the train pointed it out that she looked into getting something changed ' to get it done because a drunk stranger commented on it would be silly , ' she said			1
' why should i care what he thinks ? i had the surgery done for me			0
for years , my friends had got used to sending photos from nights out and birthdays to me for screening and editing before uploading online			0
' for years , i ’d avoided having photos sideways on			0
for years , i ’d stood talking to friends , family , strangers wondering if they ’d noticed my horrible nose			2
finally i decided it was time to bring that to an end			0
' why live like that when cosmetic surgery could put an end to it ? i ’d watched friends spend money on expensive cars and expensive clothes			0
i ’d always been so careful with money , i ’d never really blown money on something selfish			0
' i had a good job and money in the bank , and decided it was time i did something that was just for me			2
the only resolution was cosmetic surgery			0
and it would be money well spent if it helped improve my confidence and my happiness			1
' @entity5 did n't talk to too many people about the procedure but told her boyfriend , and while she says he loves her for who she is , he was supportive as he just wanted her to be happy			1

she said : ' my nose was smaller , straighter and immeasurably better than it was before			2
i had been scared that i would n’t look like " me " any more , but i was wrong			0
