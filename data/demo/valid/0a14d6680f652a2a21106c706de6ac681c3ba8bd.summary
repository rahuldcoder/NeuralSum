the future does n’t look too much rosier either			0
‘ while interest rate rises may be on the cards next year , when they come they are likely to be small and slow			0
’ interest rates were 5 per cent in september 2008 – the month @entity36 investment banking giant @entity35 collapsed			1
but they were cut aggressively as the global financial crisis deepened , before reaching an all - time low of 0.5 per cent on march 5 , 2009			2
