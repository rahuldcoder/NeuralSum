half of the @entity1 are yet to hit the fabled 40 points needed to renew membership for next season			2
but only once in the past decade — wolves in 2011 — has a team required that total to avoid the drop			0
rather , @entity9 has calculated that the magic number is just 36			0
since the turn of the millennium and the establishment of a hierarchy within the top flight — meaning more points are distributed higher up the table — the average of the club finishing third from bottom has been a shade above 35			2
struggling duo @entity23 and @entity25 look destined to be heading for the @entity26 at the end of the season the current bottom six of the @entity1 that being the case , you can assume that every team upwards of 13th - placed @entity33 , on 33 points , will be feeding off the @entity1 cash cow come august			1
indeed , this weekend saw the bottom six all lose and a points - per - game projection would have all of them finishing the campaign on fewer than 36			2
but with @entity25 and @entity23 looking increasingly doomed , it is @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 battling to avoid that final spot			1
@entity40 ( odds on being relegated : 5/2 ) run - in : @entity51 ( a ) , @entity50 ( a ) , @entity46 ( h ) , @entity47 ( a ) , @entity48 ( h ) , @entity42 ( h ) , @entity49 ( a ) , @entity45 ( h )			1
without back - to - back wins over @entity23 and @entity39 — inspired by deadline - day arrival @entity53 — @entity40 would be odds - on for the drop			1
just look at their daunting run - in			0
remember @entity58 12 months ago ? at this juncture they were 13th and seven points clear of the bottom three			0
but one point from their final seven matches — which included games against the top four — saw them demoted to the @entity26			1
@entity70 ’s side finish with a trip to @entity49 and the visit of @entity45 and they ’ll want to be clear of trouble come the final fortnight			0
verdict : they might scramble to about 34 points , and that should be enough , just			0
@entity79 ( right ) will be hoping his side can climb the table during the final batch of league fixtures @entity39 ( odds on being relegated : 7/2 ) run - in : @entity45 ( a ) , @entity23 ( h ) , @entity49 ( a ) , @entity87 ( a ) , @entity85 ( h ) , @entity86 ( h ) , @entity50 ( a ) , @entity42 ( h )			1
if the bounce factor of @entity91 ’s arrival falls flat , a deflated @entity39 could soon be sucked back into serious trouble			2
three of the next four are at @entity94 , @entity95 and the @entity96 and that , you would think , will throw up zero points			0
there is also the complicating factor of an @entity103 semi-final			0
verdict : home games against @entity23 , @entity86 and @entity42 will decide their fate — if they take six points from these and a draw elsewhere , then they should be fine			1
@entity39 striker @entity108 has scored six goals for the @entity111 outfit so far this season @entity41 ( odds on being relegated : 5/4 ) run - in : @entity113 ( h ) , @entity47 ( h ) , @entity115 ( a ) , @entity50 ( h ) , @entity85 ( a ) , @entity25 ( h ) , @entity48 ( a ) , @entity116 ( a )			1
@entity41 were better during @entity118 ’s first game in charge at @entity86			1
however , it still ended in defeat			0
and given that they see out the campaign with trips to @entity48 and @entity116 , the @entity122 boss probably has six games to save the season and preserve his record of never having been relegated			2
supposed january saviour @entity129 is misfiring and the @entity41 have scored just once in 11 hours			2
verdict : the club should have realised that they were heading for a relegation battle far sooner			0
fail to win the @entity132 on @entity133 and they could be set on a downward spiral which will surely end in the championship			0
@entity41 signed @entity129 in hope that he can score the goals to fire the @entity41 to safety @entity42 ( odds on being relegated : 10/11 ) run - in : @entity49 ( h ) , @entity48 ( h ) , @entity85 ( a ) , @entity25 ( h ) , @entity86 ( a ) , @entity40 ( a ) , @entity115 ( h ) , @entity39 ( a ) a recent victory over @entity87 and a draw at @entity116 shows that @entity144 ’s men show little regard for reputations and that spirit will serve them well as the stakes increase during the closing weeks			1
crucially , they play three of their relegation rivals and , to that end , their fate remains in their own hands			0
verdict : if @entity42 can take eight points from eight games then it could well prove enough and @entity144 would be shortlisted for @entity159 recognition			1
@entity42 striker @entity160 is attracting interest from some of the @entity1 's big boys @entity164 ... 15th — @entity39 ( 35 pts ) 16th — @entity40 ( 34 pts ) 17th — @entity42 ( 33 pts ) 18th — @entity41 ( 32 pts )			1

@entity42 currently occupy 18th spot with 25 points from **30** matches
@entity118 's @entity41 are above the relegation zone with 26 points
@entity39 and @entity40 have both ascertained *28* points from **30** games
