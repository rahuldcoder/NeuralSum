@entity0 has criticised a controversial @entity2 ruling to stop 430,000 civil servants talking to journalists			1
the mayor of @entity6 raised concerns about a change to the civil service code , quietly introduced last week , which makes it clear that officials can be sacked if they speak out before checking with a minister			1
cabinet office minister @entity14 agreed to redraft guidance to ‘ strengthen protection ’ for those speaking out to blow the whistle on scandals or abuses of public money , and include a commitment to being ‘ as open as possible ’ with @entity23 and the public			1
the mayor of @entity6 , pictured during a visit to @entity27 last week , disagrees with the new rule to stop civil servants speaking to the press however , that has failed to satisfy critics who have asked why such a change has been enforced just before the general election campaign			1
mr @entity0 , a former journalist , told the @entity35 : ‘ i believe in maximum possible transparency			1
@entity37 is the best disinfectant			1
‘ there ’s virtually nothing that you can say or do that is n’t instantly @entity43 - able			1
although it ’s painful and difficult for politicians , it ’s a bloody good thing			2
it does lead actually to better government			2
i ’m in favour of people being able to discuss things as freely as they can			2
‘ when i look back at my time in @entity52 , it ’s quite incredible how i took over an operation staffed overwhelmingly by people who did n’t share my political views			2
do we get people trying to brief the media ? absolutely not			2
mr @entity0 said he believed in ' maximum possible transparency ' ‘ most civil servants understand that there ’s a difference between being useful and helping public debate , and undermining the operation that they are in			1
i ’m in favour of transparency			0
’ mr @entity0 said he was concerned that there would be a repeat of the @entity69 ‘ chill ’ between the media and the police , which he described as ‘ crazy ’			0
‘ one of the difficulties that there has been is in the case of relations between police and the media			0
relations between police and the media have always been pretty free , ’ he said			0
‘ publicity is one of the utensils of crime - fighting , ’ he said			0
mr @entity0 raised wider questions about historic police investigations , such as those going on into child abuse allegations dating back decades			0
‘ one thing i am concerned about is the extent to which police time and resources can be devoted to what you might call policing the past - policing previous police investigations into what may or may not have been criminal offences , ’ he said			0
‘ we have got to be careful			0
i can see the huge sensitivities , and there may be people out there who feel they have been victims			0
but we also need to fight everyday crimes of violence and burglary			0
’ the @entity105 insists that the amendment to the civil service code will not affect contacts between journalists and press officers or advisers who regularly speak to the media			1
they insist the new provision simply ‘ clarifies ’ current practice , and say whistleblowers have legal protections			0
the change appears have been agreed by sir @entity119 , the cabinet secretary , who has been dubbed sir @entity120 over the long delays to the @entity122 into the @entity123			1
however , the impetus is understood to have come from ministers , who wanted to control the flow of information from departments to make clear that they , not civil servants , are ultimately in charge			1
a government source insisted : ‘ we would be deeply concerned if there was a chilling effect which limited the ability of @entity23 and the @entity137 to expose waste and wrongdoing ’ .			0
