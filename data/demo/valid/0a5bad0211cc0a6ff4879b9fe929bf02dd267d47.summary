you know they are going to be technical and strong , and that 's what they were			2
but we thought we could match them - we did that and ended up getting the result			2
' we are hoping we will play against them at some point either in the semi-final or final in the @entity44 - that would be nice			2
it would be another tough game			0
' they are a good side , so for us to get the win , that was the important thing			0
' the win against @entity3 was @entity2 's third against fellow finalists with @entity55 and the hosts having already succumbed at their hands , and while @entity9 is confident progress is being made , he is taking nothing for granted			1
@entity2 were heading towards defeat before @entity62 's strike on 79 minutes he said : ' we have got depth , which really excites me because i do n't think you can go to a tournament relying on a couple of players			2
' we have shown across the campaign - we started with the likes of @entity73 [ @entity74 ] in , we have had @entity75 in , we have had to win matches without all of these players at different times , without @entity79 [ @entity80 ] , without @entity81 [ @entity82 ] , and they have kept doing it			2
' and then new players have emerged , people like @entity87 [ @entity88 ] , who has come back from injury and who has got great potential ; @entity92 has just come into the squad			0
' the 23 , i am probably reasonably clear on 21			0
there are a couple of places that still , in my mind , people are playing for , but i know whoever goes is totally committed			0
there wo n't be any loafing around , there wo n't be any lads who feel it 's a chore to go			0
@entity2 boss @entity105 looks on during the friendly clash at the @entity15 ' they 'll be in there backing their team - mates , and again , that 's important going into a tournament			1
' @entity2 's players had to back each other throughout a testing 90 minutes on @entity114 during which impressive @entity116 striker @entity115 fired the visitors into a 15th - minute lead and after @entity120 winger @entity88 , currently on loan at @entity122 , had levelled , restored their lead five minutes after the restart			1
but there was to be a twist and after @entity127 's @entity62 had made it 2 - 2 10 minutes from time , skipper @entity27 capped a fine individual display with an 82nd - minute winner , to the delight of a crowd of 30,178			1
@entity88 ( centre ) races off to celebrate his first goal for @entity2 's @entity137 21s the @entity2 youngsters celebrate @entity140 's later winner in front of the @entity15 crowd it proved the perfect conclusion to the perfect evening for @entity0 , representing his country on his own home ground			1
