things usually end badly for @entity1 in @entity2			1
@entity3 culminated in a tear - jerker in this city , as did the @entity6 in 1980 , and @entity8 ’s first game as captain was another defeat at the turn of the century			2
it was 1948 when @entity1 last won here and even @entity15 ’s cliff - hanger in @entity16 , a heist film based around an @entity1 game in @entity2 , did not go to plan — and that was not even real			1
@entity20 , too , admits his personal record playing @entity22 when he was coaching in @entity23 was not up to much either , so there was no surprise when he and his captain @entity26 insisted they were much keener to talk about the future than the past			1
@entity1 manager @entity20 looks on during a press conference ahead of the match against @entity23 @entity32 poses just days after grabbing his first international goal on his @entity1 debut here is the first real test for @entity20 ’s new wave , playing away against one of the major @entity40 nations , even if both teams have something of an experimental feel to them			1
@entity20 chose to take a young squad to the @entity45 in the hope that experience would pay off in the long run and he can go some way to claiming that it already has with seven wins out of seven , while others including @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity23 have stuttered amid the complacent environment that is the @entity56 qualifying campaign			1
@entity20 speaks to his players on the pitch in @entity2 ahead of tuesday 's friendly match against @entity23 @entity61 striker @entity60 could be in line to start for @entity23 against @entity1 on tuesday @entity23 midfielder @entity63 ( second left ) controls the ball as @entity23 prepare to take on @entity1 @entity65 ( fourth right ) addresses his team as they look to put an end to @entity1 's seven wins the manager remains rightly cautious about getting carried away on the basis of handsome victories against @entity73 and @entity74			1
‘ i ’m always frightened to say those things , ’ said @entity20 , but he is quietly satisfied with almost everything that has happened since his team returned from @entity76			1
‘ you never know , ’ he added			2
‘ certainly , there seems to be a group and a talent pool that is growing all the time			2
some of the talent that ’s already been with us for a couple of years , i see signs of them becoming more comfortable , assured in their play not only with their clubs but with @entity1			1
the teams we select have a lot of energy and pace around them			2
these are good qualities a team badly needs			2
@entity96 and energy mean you cause teams problems when you attack and when you defend it helps prevent any damage			2
‘ if we can keep this group of 20 - odd players together , they ’ll get more international experience and hopefully in a year ’s time we might be stronger than we are today			2
‘ but i do n’t feel we ’re lagging any more			0
or that other teams are moving forward faster than us			0
by the finals in @entity108 , hopefully we ’ll be closer to that			0
’ perhaps they will if @entity32 tackles the challenge of his first start as he did his first appearance			1
or if another player emerges to demand a place in the team			0
even then , the usual fear that @entity1 have qualified stylishly in the past only to malfunction during the tournaments , will remain			1
one of the reasons they have struggled when stepping up a level in recent tournaments has been because they lack the depth of players in defensive areas , including defensive midfield , to give the team a healthy balance			0
so it will be interesting to see how @entity131 performs if he is deployed in midfield as expected			0
@entity26 answers the questions from the press as @entity1 continue preparations for @entity23 @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity32 inspect the pitch during a team stadium visit goalkeeping coach @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 check out the stadium @entity146 ( right ) controls the ball under pressure from @entity149 during training in @entity2 @entity20 urged supporters to wait and judge his team in a series of friendlies being planned against what he called ‘ top - class opponents , teams on a par with @entity23 ’ next season			1
@entity1 will play @entity108 and @entity160 in november , assuming they all avoid the need to play off			1
they are away in @entity53 in march next year and are in talks for a friendly against @entity54			0
‘ it will be much more relevant when we qualify , ’ said @entity20 , who always seems to come over all misty - eyed when he returns to @entity23 and spoke with touching fondness of the moment he was invited by @entity166 to coach @entity167			1
@entity65 was also emotional as he discussed his first return to the @entity170 , although the @entity23 boss has more immediate problems amid suggestions that he regrets his decision to swap club football for the chance to lead the @entity23 to @entity56			1
the @entity1 squad check out the @entity170 pitch in @entity2 ahead of their friendly match with @entity23 @entity143 and the @entity1 squad share a joke as they tour the @entity170 in @entity2 ahead of their match @entity183 ( centre ) attempts to intercept @entity186 's ( left ) pass during @entity23 training already it has damaged his relationship with @entity22 , the club he loves , where he played more than 400 games , many as captain and won three titles as coach			1
@entity65 , new to international management , has been swamped by controversies around an injury to @entity199 , which prompted a death - threat , but turned out not to be as bad as first feared and his decision to call - up @entity76 - born @entity203 , who will start tonight , and @entity205 - born @entity204			2
‘ what am i missing , what am i lacking ? ’ said @entity65			0
‘ i do n’t know if i ’m missing anything			0
regardless of what ’s going on i will keep working and moving forward			0
sometimes i ask myself questions and do n’t know the answers			0
’ @entity32 looks around at the huge @entity170 as he prepares to make his full debut against @entity23 @entity213 missed @entity23 's @entity215 match with illness but was back in training on monday the return of @entity213 ( right ) provided a major boost to @entity23 ahead of their encounter against @entity1 @entity213 is fit to start after a fever but this @entity224 generation is near to the end and braced for a transitional phase			1
‘ there ’s been a big turnover in terms of players and experience at every level and whenever that happens you need a minimum level of patience , ’ said @entity65			0
‘ you need to allow the players to grow without being critical at every opportunity			0
i do n’t think this is helpful			0
‘ when i say we have to be left to work it ’s because we have to work			0
we do n’t have a lot of time because the @entity244 is next year			2
all i can promise is that we can work very hard			0
’ the two teams are in different places			0
you would rather be @entity20 than @entity65 and yet we have heard this before			1
there were similar noises from both camps before they met in @entity252 , nine months ago			0
even if @entity1 prefer to look forward , history is against them in more ways than one			1
@entity256 ( right ) controls the ball with his chest as @entity259 closes him down			0

@entity1 face @entity23 in @entity2 on the back of seven *successive* victories
but the @entity1 have an *undeniably* poor record playing away in @entity23
the last time an @entity1 side came home from @entity23 with a win was 1948
@entity26 insists it 's time to concentrate on the future not the past
read : @entity32 will start up front with @entity26 , says @entity20
