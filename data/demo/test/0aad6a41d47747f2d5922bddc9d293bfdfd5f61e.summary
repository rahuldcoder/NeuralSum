as composed and as comfortable as @entity2 were here at the @entity4 , performances like this succeed only in highlighting the full extent of their failure this season			1
in @entity10 they boast the joint leading scorer in the @entity12			1
here against @entity13 he scored his 20th of the campaign			2
and in @entity17 and @entity18 , not to mention a seemingly revitalised @entity19 , they had players far too accomplished for the quality of this opposition			1
but such a dominant , determined display must leave the club ’s owners wondering why on earth this was only their third win in nine games after a run of six defeats in their previous eight			0
why , even when @entity13 were as abject as they were until @entity2 lost @entity17 to serious injury , they have been unable to play with such confidence more frequently			0
@entity10 slotted @entity2 into a two goal lead after a fine flowing counter attack by the home side against @entity13 the @entity39 striker sprints away in celebration having fired in his 20th league goal of the season to put @entity2 2 - 0 up at the break @entity18 ( right ) , who provided the assist for @entity10 , congratulates his team - mate as @entity2 celebrated going 2 - 0 up at the @entity4 @entity13 defender @entity46 ( centre ) watches on in despair as his miss - timed clearance loops over @entity50 for an own goal @entity2 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity52 6 ; @entity53 6.5 , @entity54 6 , @entity55 7 , @entity56 6.5 ; @entity57 6 ( @entity58 88 ) , @entity59 6.5 , @entity18 8 , @entity19 7 , @entity17 6.5 ( @entity60 75 ) ; @entity10 7.5 ( @entity61 90 ) subs not used : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 booked : @entity18 , @entity17 scorers : @entity68 18 , @entity10 36 manager : @entity70 6.5 man of the match : @entity18 @entity13 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity50 6 ; @entity73 6 , @entity46 5 , @entity74 5.5 , @entity75 5.5 ; @entity76 5 , @entity77 5 ( @entity78 66 ) , @entity79 6 ; @entity80 4.5 , @entity81 4.5 ( @entity82 66 ) , @entity83 6 subs not used : @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 booked : @entity79 , @entity80 manager : @entity91 5 referee : @entity93 6.5 attendance : 45,041 @entity10 capped off a fine @entity2 counter attack ( above )			1

but there is sure to remain a fair amount of frustration in @entity108 that the last few months have proved so problematic			0
by the end of this encounter the greater , more pressing , concern was for the welfare of @entity17			0
injured from what both managers agreed was an accidental elbow in the face from @entity79 midway through the second half , the @entity119 international required oxygen before leaving the pitch on a stretcher after eight minutes of treatment			0
he was then taken to hospital			0
but other problems nevertheless remain for @entity2 ’s manager @entity70 when he had to wake to headlines being generated by the notoriously vocal agent of @entity19 , who reportedly accused the @entity129 of being ‘ a weak manager ’ as well as criticising other prominent members of the club hierarchy , too			1
@entity70 was asked to respond but declined to comment			2
with managers such as @entity135 now available for hire , these stories are poorly timed for @entity70			2
but he can at least take comfort in the way his team responded to that crushing defeat at @entity141 the previous weekend			0
‘ after two defeats in a row it was a very important win , ’ added @entity70			2
@entity2 manager @entity70 watches on at the @entity4 as his side seeked to get back to winning ways on sunday @entity79 ( left ) tries to keep possession under the challenge from @entity2 skipper @entity19 @entity149 duo @entity76 ( left ) and @entity57 vie for the ball as @entity13 traveled to the @entity4 to take on @entity2 @entity56 goes down under the challenge of @entity13 defender @entity73 in the penalty area but was only awarded a corner with another match here at home coming next , against @entity157 , @entity2 ’s manager is sure to be encouraged by the form of @entity10			1
until sunday he had failed to score a @entity12 goal from open play at the @entity4 since november 2			1
but the goal he scored in this contest was neatly taken ; much more like the striker @entity2 ’s subdued supporters have grown to admire			2
he thrived on the possession @entity2 were enjoying — 75 per cent for the first 15 minutes — and joined @entity17 and @entity166 in threatening @entity13 ’s goal early on			2
@entity2 ’s opening goal , scored after 18 minutes , was an absolute horror for @entity13			0
@entity170 came @entity75 ’s failure to win an aerial contest with the diminutive @entity173 , and then a spectacular own goal from @entity46			1
winger @entity80 ( centre ) attempts to avoid the attention of @entity2 full back @entity56 at the @entity4 @entity39 right back @entity53 reacts after referee @entity93 awards a freekick to @entity13 for a foul on @entity77 ( right ) @entity50 ( centre ) desperately attempts to keep out a deflected @entity46 clearance but the ball ends up in the back of the net in trying to intercept a cross from @entity187 , the @entity13 centre half succeeded only in scoring with a sliced volley , the ball spinning off his boot and over the head of @entity50 before flying home via the underside of the crossbar			1
if it was a little unfortunate for the visitors it remained a product of the pressure @entity2 were exerting			0
a @entity13 side probably unsettled by the uncertainty surrounding their own manager offered little in return			0
@entity81 almost seized on a mistake from @entity54 only for @entity52 to block his shot , while @entity2 ’s goalkeeper then marked his 28th birthday by denying @entity207			0
@entity13 centre back is left stunned after his mis - timed clearance turned into an unfortunate own goal during the first - half @entity10 collects the ball after @entity2 's opener despite @entity13 keeper @entity50 's ( centre ) best efforts to keep it out the @entity2 players celebrate having taken an early lead at the @entity4 on sunday against @entity13 during the @entity12 clash the control nevertheless remained with @entity2 , a second goal arriving in the 36th minute after @entity19 had regained possession from @entity80			1
a rapidly executed counter-attack followed , with @entity10 and @entity18 combining impressively before @entity10 slotted home his 101st @entity2 goal			1
in the dug - out @entity91 appeared thoroughly hacked off , and understandably so given the ineptitude of his defenders and his side ’s lack of ambition going forward			0
he responded at the start of the second half by pushing @entity83 into a more attacking role alongside @entity81			0
but it was @entity2 who continued to press , with @entity50 doing well to deny @entity10 a second			1
the injury to @entity17 — earning @entity79 a yellow card despite the fact that it really did n’t look intentional — disrupted @entity2 ’s rhythm and gave @entity13 a little encouragement			0
@entity80 went close , as did @entity83			0
for once @entity70 had reason to feel a touch more secure			2
@entity2 playmaker @entity17 slips through a pass during another attack for the home side against @entity13 on sunday @entity10 sprints towards the @entity2 fans who erupted into celebration having seen the @entity39 score their second goal on sunday @entity57 lets fire with a shot at the @entity4 but could n't find the back of the net with this long range effort on sunday afternoon @entity254 no 1 goalkeeper @entity52 had a quiet afternoon but still managed to impress with a couple of fine saves to maintain a clean sheet @entity18 leaps into action to nod on a pass at the @entity4 with @entity13 striker @entity81 ( right ) watching on @entity93 books @entity13 midfielder @entity79 ( centre ) after he appeared to elbow @entity17 @entity17 had to receive treatment on the pitch for over six minutes after the collision with @entity79 abd was eventually replaced @entity17 had to be replaced late in the second - half and exited the filed of play on a stretcher after being hit in the face by @entity79 's elbow @entity52 , 28 years - old on sunday , watches on at the @entity4 as his @entity2 side faced @entity13 in the @entity12			1

the home side were gifted the lead after @entity46 sliced a cross over @entity50 for an *astonishing* own goal
a devastating counter-attacking goal was swept in by @entity10 for his 20th league goal of the season
the victory moved @entity70 's side back to within one point of @entity103 in third in the league
