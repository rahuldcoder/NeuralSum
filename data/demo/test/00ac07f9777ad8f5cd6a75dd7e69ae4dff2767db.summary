when @entity1 passed away in a freak accident last july , he left behind his heavily - pregnant girlfriend and their unborn son			1
but now , nearly eight months after his passing , the young @entity7 family has been reunited in their first ever family portrait , thanks to some clever photoshopping by a local photographer			1
@entity14 was snapping pictures of six - month - old @entity16 and his 20 - year - old mother , @entity17 , when the young mom asked the photographer if she could make their family complete			1
so @entity22 took a photograph of @entity1 from the family and , with a ghostly filter , fitted the image around his girlfriend and son , as if he were standing over them			1
@entity1 passed away before his son 's birth @entity17 called the ghostly final picture ' amazing '			1
' @entity1 's not physically here with us , of course , but that picture represents to us that he is always watching over us and he will always be there for us no matter what , ' she told @entity47			2
after sharing the image to her @entity51 page , the photographer found that other people thought the image was amazing too			2
it has been liked more than 200,000 times and shared more than 25,000 times , and @entity22 has been inundated with requests to create other pictures for families who have lost a loved one			1
in a post shared on the @entity51 page , @entity17 explained that in july 2014 , she and 26 - year - old @entity1 had been nervous about the impending birth of their son			1
' we were scared as any new parents would be but ready for the adventure together , ' she said			0
excitement : 26 - year - old @entity1 , pictured with his girlfriend in the couple 's pregnancy announcement , died after hitting his head in an accident in july 2014			1
his son was born just a few weeks later when she was around eight months pregnant , they went to jet boat races in @entity80 , she recalled			2
but the weather was too warm for @entity17 , so she left her boyfriend there with his family			2
' when i left @entity1 that day i had no clue it would be the last time i 'd see him , ' she wrote			2
but in the early hours of the next day , she awoke to a call that @entity1 had been rushed to the @entity88 in @entity89 after he had fallen and hit his head			2
she and her mother raced to his side			0
they never considered his injuries could be life - threatening , but once they got there , they were given ' absolutely no hope that @entity1 was going to make it '			2
' july 13th 2014 was the absolute worst day of my life , ' she explained			0
' i lost my best friend			0
the father of my unborn child			0
and since that day i have felt so empty inside			0
a part of me will forever be missing			0
i loved that man more than life itself			0
' strong : @entity17 said that part of her has been missing since the death of @entity16 ' father but that the photograph allowed her to see her complete family for the first time			1
she is pictured in another image from the shoot missed : she said she knows that @entity1 , pictured left , will always be watching over her and their son , right their son was born just a few weeks later and when he approached six months , @entity17 asked @entity22 , who is baked in @entity117 , if she 'd be able to put together a family photo			1
' i just got to thinking , we do n't have a picture with @entity1 in it , ' @entity17 explained to @entity47			1
so @entity123 created the photo that has since been shared thousands of times online			1
' it brought me to tears , ' @entity17 wrote about the photograph			0
' this is how i picture us			0
@entity16 and i living our lives the best we can with @entity1 always watching over our shoulder			1
' @entity123 said she was happy to be able to help			0
' as soon as i met @entity16 , he had a smile that was so contagious , the happiest baby boy , and he instantly captured my heart , ' she said on her @entity51 page			0
' [ @entity138 ] never knew if i could make this reality for them			0
so glad i could and they can cherish this forever			0
