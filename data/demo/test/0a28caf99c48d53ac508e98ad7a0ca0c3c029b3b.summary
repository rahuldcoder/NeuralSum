victim : dr @entity1 the @entity2 repeatedly deceived @entity3 by destroying vital files relating to the assassination of @entity1 , a new book claims			1
leading @entity1 historian @entity7 said that the bureau chose to cover up the potential role of a high level informant in the killing rather than tell the truth			1
@entity7 said that it could have been one of the greatest scandals in the history of the @entity2 - but now we may never know what happened			1
by destroying the files the @entity2 disobeyed a direct order not to do so from a @entity20 which had been set up to investigate the killing of @entity1 and former president @entity22			1
@entity7 told @entity23 that the bureau 's actions were ' disturbing ' and that his research had left him suspecting that agents had mounted a deliberate operation to bury the truth forever			1
@entity1 was shot dead by @entity30 on 4 april 1968 at the @entity31 in @entity32 in a killing which galvanized the civil rights movement			1
power : dr @entity1 's leadership of the civil rights movement was demonstrated in the @entity39 in 1963			1
his death on 4 april 1968 shocked a nation already scarred by the deaths of president @entity22 - and the civil leader 's murder was followed by that of @entity47 guard : the balcony at the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity50 , where dr @entity1 was shot			1
caught : @entity30 , the assassin of dr. @entity51			0
being taken to his cell by sheriff @entity53 , in @entity32 , july 19 , 1968			0
he had been on the run since the death @entity57 figures : @entity30 ( left ) in the wanted picture issued by the @entity2			2
@entity59 ( right ) was a racist known for a covertly recorded interview in 1963 in which he spoke of the @entity22 and @entity1 assassinations before they happened interest in @entity1 's life has been renewed since the release of the @entity68 - winning film ' @entity69 ' , about the historic march from the @entity72 town , which was 50 years ago this year			1
but @entity7 said that there are still many unanswered questions about his death which he addresses in a new e-book called ' @entity77 '			0
the @entity2 plot began when the @entity79 was set up in 1976 - it would finish its inquiries into the killing of @entity1 and @entity22 in 1978			1
@entity7 said that the @entity2 appears to have been spooked after an investigative reporter called @entity83 published a number of articles about the @entity87 connection to both assassinations , articles which the committee were interested in			2
@entity7 said that , according to his research , in 1977 the @entity92 ( murder of @entity1 ) files were destroyed from the @entity2 field offices in @entity87 and @entity96 , @entity72			1
crucially , both had information on @entity99 , a former high ranking @entity100 member from @entity101			1
@entity7 said that something in that file made the @entity2 upgrade @entity99 from a little - known racist activist to major player in the @entity1 assassination to the point where they showed his picture to witnesses at major crime scenes			1
what that something was , it now seems we will never know			0
also destroyed from the @entity87 field office was the the file on @entity59 , a well - known racist who is known for a covertly recorded interview he gave in 1963 in which he talks about the @entity22 assassination and the @entity1 assassination before they happened			1
@entity7 said : ' it 's entirely possible that @entity59 was raising the bounty money for @entity1 's assassination			1
' the destruction of the files broke a key rule of the @entity2 's record keeping ; that it does n't get rid of information on people who are still alive			1
@entity99 was alive then - and he still is today			2
according to @entity7 , every other field office investigation of the @entity1 murder was preserved , just as @entity3 ordered , and eventually transferred to the @entity133			1
@entity7 said : ' i have no doubt this was done deliberately			0
they are not destroying everybody 's files , they are selectively destroying files			2
' they wanted @entity99 to give evidence to the committee , they did n't want him to be a suspect			0
@entity145 : @entity99 was a figure in the @entity145 and seemed initially marginal to the investigation into the @entity1 murder but was suddenly made a significant figure			1
was it because of his links to another more senior figure that files were destroyed ? in charge : @entity155 , the @entity2 chief , had condemned dr @entity1 and had a mantra that protecting the bureau 's reputation was all that mattered			1
@entity7 says his successor stuck to that belief dramatic hearing : @entity30 testifies in 1978 before the @entity164			2
at left is @entity30 's attorney @entity166			0
@entity30 told the panel he did not kill @entity1 ' by that point @entity99 had already made a conversion away from radical racist @entity170 - he is now a preacher			1
' until then he had been in prison for a bombing and he 'd made a full conversion			0
the @entity2 arranged for him to get out of prison , which was unheard of			0
' @entity7 said that another reason why @entity99 was problematic is that he led directly to the @entity100 in @entity101 , which was one of the most violent anti-black chapters of the group at the time			2
he said : ' @entity180			0
also known as @entity181 , was due to take over as head of the @entity100 there and @entity180 was a big time deep cover agent for the @entity2			1
' we can imagine a situation where the @entity2 does not want the @entity20 investigation to lead back to @entity180			2
' they did not want to expose him to suspicion			0
imagine what it would have looked like if an @entity2 informant had a connection to the @entity1 assassination ? ' this is speculation of course , but it would have been was on the worst scandals in the history of the @entity2 '			2
if the @entity2 had covered its tracks over @entity1 's assassination , it would fit into the pattern of duplicity and double dealing that marked the bureau 's handling of @entity1			2
the @entity2 had put him under intense surveillance and bugged his hotel rooms and attempted to destroy his marriage by sending his wife recordings of him with other women			0
at a press conference in 1964 then @entity2 director @entity211 went so far as to call @entity1 the ' most notorious liar in the country '			2
portrayal : @entity216 in his acclaimed performance as dr @entity1 in this year 's movie @entity69 never forgotten : the memorial at the site of dr @entity1 's assassination			2
a few days later one of his deputies , @entity224 , wrote a vicious letter to @entity1 and gave it to an agent in @entity87 to post to him in @entity228			0
it became known as the ' suicide letter ' and called him ' filthy ' and ' abnormal ' and urged him to take his own life			0
the letter read : ' in view of your low grade , abnormal personal behavior i will not dignify your name with either a mr. or a @entity239 or a dr. ' and , your last name calls to mind only the type of @entity1 such as @entity243 and his countless acts of adultery and immoral conduct lower than that of a beast			0
' the head of the @entity2 between 1973 and 1978 was @entity250 , a staunch ally of @entity155			0
@entity7 described @entity250 as a man who followed @entity155 's mantra that the reputation of the bureau was the most important thing , ' no matter what '			0
@entity7 said that the @entity2 could still go some way to salvaging its reputation ; one way of doing so would be to give @entity1 's case to the @entity263 's @entity262 team , which has looked as more than one hundred civil rights crimes , mostly from the 1960s			1
he also implored the @entity2 to run the fingerprints it has from the various crime scenes such as rooming house and car used by @entity30			0
the last time it did so was in 2000 when the integrated automated fingerprint identification system was in its infancy and could not even recognize palm prints			0
it also only covered one state and had a tiny database			0
@entity7 said : ' now the database is three times larger and covers 50 states			0
they could run the tests in a day			0
if they want copies of the prints i have them all , digitized			0

@entity2 accused in new book - by leading @entity1 historian @entity7 - of *misleading* @entity3 by destroying files on civil rights leader 's murder
he tells @entity23 agency disobeyed direct order to preserve all materials and believes it was to protect informer from being identified
@entity99 , high - ranking @entity145 member went from being little - known racist to having his picture shown to witnesses
files from two field offices which had information on @entity305 were destroyed in 1977 after @entity3 *launched* @entity164
@entity7 believes it is because they could have exposed @entity180 , head of @entity145 , as an @entity2 asset under deep cover
