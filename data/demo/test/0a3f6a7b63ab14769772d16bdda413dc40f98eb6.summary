@entity1 manager @entity0 believes recent defeats are down to his players ' own failings rather than the opposition having cracked their system			1
the @entity8 ' 3 - 4 - 2 - 1 formation , implemented from mid-december , helped produce a 13 - match unbeaten @entity10 run which lifted them to within a win of breaking back into the @entity15 qualification places			1
but despite receiving plaudits for the quality of their football , which at times appeared to be unplayable , flaws started to appear a month ago when they were held to a goalless draw by @entity24 side @entity23 in the @entity25			2
@entity0 says his sides recent defeats are down to his players , not his tactics being susses after scraping a win against @entity33 they were then exposed by @entity34 and @entity35 , two teams already in the top four			1
however , @entity0 insists a drop - off in results is more to do with their own performances than those of their opponents			1
' i do n't think it 's about being worked out			2
we did n't start well ( against @entity35 ) , and it does n't matter what system you are playing if that happens , ' he said			0
' in the last four games that we 've played we have n't created as much , and that 's more on ourselves			0
@entity1 have lost ground in the race for the @entity15 places and will find it hard to recover ' of course you give opponents credit but every team will go into a game to defend well and work hard against you			1
' probably the @entity23 game when we drew 0 - 0 and the games following that we have n't created as much			0
' that 's something that we want to reinforce - the creativity for chances and hopefully taking those chances			0
' it 's a difficult system to play against , but it 's one of a number of systems we 've played here and played very well			0
@entity73 fires home @entity35 's third goal , as the @entity76 thrashed @entity1 at the @entity77 ' it 's my job to always look to find the solutions , that 's what i 've tried to do in the games when we did n't look like scoring , finding a way to win			1
' @entity23 , who host @entity1 in their @entity25 quarter - final replay on wednesday , will take heart from the @entity90 ' mini-slump at a crucial time of the season			1
for @entity0 and @entity1 though the cup now represents the only chance to save their season and that should guarantee a reaction at @entity99			1
' it 's important to have a game quickly when you lose , ' added @entity0			2
' the group is very committed to winning this trophy but in order to do that you have to qualify and we know @entity23 will be a difficult game for us			0
@entity109 ( left ) and @entity110 look on as @entity0 give a talk to his players and staff ' a trophy this season will mark another step forward for us			1
getting to a final and winning a trophy is what we want			0
' in terms of the @entity25 that was always an objective			0
' on wednesday , we 'll look to reach our second semi-final of the season in the cup competitions ( having been narrowly beaten by @entity126 over two legs )			0
' with the play - offs out of reach for @entity23 they will also be putting all their efforts into trying to reach a @entity133 last - four encounter with @entity134			0
@entity135 ( centre ) can cause @entity1 's leaky defence a number of problems in the @entity25 replay they showed enough on @entity142 a month ago to suggest they can trouble the @entity8 and , having dispatched top - flight sides @entity33 and @entity145 at @entity99 , they will have no fear of @entity1 's arrival			2
' @entity23 have got some excellent players			2
they defended well when they came to @entity149 , ' said @entity0			1
' we 'll go there really focused and determined - we ca n't wait to play again after the weekend 's disappointment			0
