a @entity1 gray whale ( pictured ) has made the longest known migration by any mammal			0
the female , named @entity5 , swam 14,000 miles ( 22,500 ) from the east coast of @entity7 to breeding grounds off the coast of @entity10 , and back , reportedly without stopping for a snack until now , scientists believed there were two distinct groups of gray whale - the @entity26 gray whale , which travels along the west coast of @entity28 , and the much rarer @entity1 gray whale , which journeys along the coast of eastern @entity31			1
the researchers used satellite - monitoring tags to track three western @entity13 gray whales from their primary feeding ground off @entity7 ’s @entity36 across the @entity13 and down the @entity37 of the @entity28 to @entity38 , @entity10			1
the experts have been monitoring the species living off the coast of @entity7 for years and tracked the record - breaking journey over five - and - half months between 2011 and 2012			1
@entity44 whales typically do n't feed during migration , which has led researchers to believe @entity5 did n't eat during the long journey either			1
they found that @entity5 , which is @entity7 for @entity50 , visited the three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , which are found off @entity53 , according to the study published by the @entity55 in the journal @entity57			1
her return journey across the @entity13 raises questions about the critically endangered creature ’s conservation status			0
experts have been monitoring the species living off the coast of @entity7 for years and tracked the record - breaking journey between 2011 and 2012			1
a @entity1 gray whale is shown ‘ it is very impressive , ’ professor @entity65 , of @entity66 , told @entity67			0
‘ these whales have the same body temperature as you and i , so they are obliged to make these big journeys to get to warmer or cooler waters			0
but this is a record			0
’ ‘ until now we thought they were not very good navigators , ’ he continued			0
@entity79 is a 13 - year - old @entity1 gray whale			1
she is now famous for making the longest migration of any mammal when she was aged nine			0
the whale was tagged off @entity7 's @entity36 in september 2011			2
experts expected her to swim along @entity31 's @entity13 shoreline down to the @entity88			0
but instead , she turned up off @entity10 's @entity38 instead and mingled with eastern gray whales near their nursery lagoon in @entity10			1
experts tracked @entity5 to find that she made a swam 14,000 miles ( 22,500 ) from the east coast of @entity7 to breeding grounds off the coast of @entity10 , and back			1
her journey is helping scientists make a surprising new discovery about migration patterns			0
‘ we thought that they just stuck to the coast , keeping the sound of the surf on one side , going up and down the coast until they met their destination			0
' on the way from @entity7 she is believed to have crossed the northern extremity of the @entity109 , before hitting @entity110 and going south until she reached the warm seas off the @entity38 peninsula to breed			0
but on her way back to @entity7 , she made a more direct route , cutting across deep water			0
‘ we do not know how she did it but the fact that she took different routes each way means we have to accept that these whales are very accomplished navigators , ’ professor mate continued			0
the study said : ‘ her 22,511 km round - trip is the longest documented mammal migration and strongly suggests that some presumed @entity1 gray whales are actually eastern gray whales foraging in areas historically attributed to @entity130 gray whales			1
’ the previous longest journey made by a mammal was held by a humpback whale , who swam more than 11,706 miles ( 18,839km ) in 2011			1
the migration from the feeding grounds was also made by two other whales who were being monitored , called @entity139 and agent , who were all tagged seven years ago			1
western gray whales were thought to have gone extinct by the 1970s before a small population was discovered in @entity7 off @entity36			1
the group is now estimated to be 150 strong and has been monitored by scientists from @entity7 and the @entity28 since the 1990s			0
the migration from the feeding grounds was also made by two other whales who were being monitored , called @entity139 and agent , who were all tagged seven years ago			1
here , experts observe the animals breaching like their western cousins , @entity26 gray whales were decimated by whaling and listed as endangered , but conservation efforts led to their recovery			1
there are now thought to be more than 18,000 of them swimming the oceans			0
but not all scientists believe that @entity1 gray whales are a separate , distinct species , raising the possibility that only @entity26 gray whales survive today			2
scientists previously thought that gray whales ' hugged ' the coastlines , either in @entity31 or @entity53			2
they thought they set their path by watching or listening to the shore			0
the whales learn their migratory route from their mothers , who take them on their first journey from the breeding grounds to more northern feeding grounds and repeat the journey the following year			1
but @entity5 travelled to @entity7 by swimming across the @entity109 , with few landmarks or shallow waters to guide her			2
she even swam a new path on the way back by following the @entity110 coast			0
one of the routes is thought to have been passed on by her mother , demonstrating previously unknown navigational skills			0
‘ the fact that endangered @entity1 gray whales have such a long range and interact with eastern gray whales was a surprise and leaves a lot of questions up in the air , ’ said @entity65 , director of the @entity184 at @entity66 and lead author on the study			1
‘ past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species , but this suggests we may need to take a closer look			0
’ @entity201 of the @entity202 , who is the @entity7 representative to the @entity204 and co-author of the study , has proposed since 2009 that recent western and @entity26 gray whale populations are not isolated			2
he said that the gray whales found in @entity7 waters are a part of an eastern population that is restoring its former historical range			1
‘ the ability of the whales to navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive and suggests that some @entity1 gray whales might actually be eastern grays , ’ dr @entity65 said			1
‘ but that does n’t mean that there may not be some true @entity1 gray whales remaining			2
‘ if so , then the number of true @entity1 gray whales is even smaller than we previously thought			2
’ protecting the endangered @entity1 gray whales has been difficult , with five whales dying in @entity227 fishing nets within the last decade			2
their feeding areas off @entity227 and @entity7 include fishing areas , shipping lanes , and oil and gas production , as well as future sites oil sites , while their largely unknown migration routes may include additional hazards .			2

western gray whales were tagged seven years ago to monitor migration
the then nine - year - old female called @entity5 swam from @entity7 to breeding grounds near @entity10 during five - and - a - half months in 2011
@entity44 whales typically do n't feed during migration , which has led researchers to believe she did n't eat during the long journey
previous record was held by a humpback who swam 11,706 miles in 2011
