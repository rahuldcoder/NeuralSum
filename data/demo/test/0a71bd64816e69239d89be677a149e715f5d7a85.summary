@entity0 looked glum at @entity2 nightclub in @entity3 after being knocked out of the @entity4 on sunday - and his @entity6 farewell tour is unlikely to have him breaking into a grin either			1
the @entity6 captain spent the evening in the vip room with friends , knowing full well that defeat by @entity12 at @entity13 confirmed what he had feared all season : he would end his final year at @entity16 without a trophy			1
sunday 's loss means there will be no birthday @entity4 final for him on may 30 , while @entity24 's victory over @entity25 in the @entity26 made it mathematically impossible for @entity6 to catch the league leaders			1
@entity0 is seen at @entity2 nightclub in @entity3 sunday night after being knocked out of the @entity4 @entity0 looked glum after it was confirmed he would end the season without a trophy before moving on @entity0 climbs into a car outside the club in @entity34 as his @entity6 career winds down to a poor ending @entity12 's players celebrate their victory at @entity13 while @entity0 reflects on the pitch in defeat sunday april 25 : @entity41 ( a ) tuesday april 28 : @entity42 ( a ) saturday may 2 : @entity43 ( @entity44 ) sunday may 10 : @entity24 ( a ) saturday may 16 : @entity45 ( @entity44 ) sunday may 24 : @entity46 ( a ) as the curtain comes down on his 17 years in the @entity6 first - team , @entity0 has just six games left to play in a red shirt with little to play for and a fixture list that seem unlikely to bring his smile back			1
among the opponents that late april and may bring are four teams in the bottom half of the @entity26 table : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity45			0
towards the end of that run , a trip to champions - elect @entity24 beckons and then @entity0 is set to play his final game in @entity62 at the @entity63 against @entity46 on may 24 , a dead - rubber that is unlikely to even be shown on television			1
while the supporters from the @entity68 will undoubtedly give their @entity70 - winning captain a huge send off at @entity16 against @entity45 on may 16 , it does give a sense of anti-climax after one of the finest careers seen in the @entity26 era			0
anything but a defeat against @entity78 for @entity24 would likely see them likely to be confirmed as champions before @entity0 comes to @entity81 , and with a title party ongoing he will be reminded of the one prize that has eluded him throughout his career in @entity62			1
@entity6 's players , including their captain , were outclassed by @entity12 at @entity13 and deservedly lost @entity13 , where @entity0 has captained his country on many occasions , now has a final bad memory for him @entity6 fans show their support for @entity0 - his latest @entity16 appearance is against @entity45 it will also bring back memories of his slip to let in @entity96 at @entity16 , almost a year ago to the day , a fatal error that robbed the 34 - year - old of a maiden title last season			1
the chance of leading a guard of honour if @entity24 seal the league crown against @entity105 or @entity45 would rub salt further into the wounds			0
@entity108 might have asked the @entity24 supporters to stop singing the about @entity0 's unfortunate tumble , but the @entity81 faithful are unlikely to relent as they take the opportunity to give their two - time transfer target a farewell he wo n't forget - for the wrong reasons			1
@entity0 slipped up in last year 's game against @entity24 to gift @entity96 a goal and throw away the title memories of that mistake will be strong in the mind for @entity0 is @entity24 are celebrating winning the league @entity62 's failure at the @entity128 - with @entity0 as captain - followed , and he quit the international game @entity0 , @entity130 and @entity131 leave the pitch after drawing their final game with @entity135 it has been a difficult final year for @entity0			1
missing out on last year 's title was followed by captaining @entity62 at a winless @entity128 and now another trophyless year where he has found himself surplus to @entity140 ' starting xi at times with @entity130 and @entity142 preferred as options in midfield			0
the decision to retire from the international game after last summer 's tournament , with a focus on his club career , did n't work out either with @entity6 knocked out of all four cups - including at the first possible opportunity in the @entity70			2
and now , a @entity26 legend bids farewell in a way that does n't seem fitting			0
there is no big finale like in @entity156 or @entity157 all those years ago , instead @entity0 leaves @entity6 and @entity62 with a whimper			2
now , the @entity6 captain 's final game is at the @entity63 - though he did score there last year april 27 , 2014 : with @entity6 seemingly set for the @entity26 title , @entity0 slips to gift @entity24 a goal in a 2 - 0 defeat at @entity16 to put the initiative back into the hands of eventual champions @entity167			1
may 5 , 2014 : @entity6 squander a 3 - 0 lead against @entity45 to see their title hopes suffer a further blow that they would not recover from			2
june 19 , 2014 : having lost their opening game against @entity173 , @entity62 are level with @entity175 until captain @entity0 gives the ball away to allow @entity177 to score a winner			2
@entity62 left the tournament without win			0
november 4 , 2014 : @entity0 is left out of the team that loses 1 - 0 at the @entity182 against @entity183 in the @entity70			0
december 9 , 2014 : the captain scores but @entity6 are knocked out of the @entity70 after a 1 - 1 draw with @entity186 leaves them on just five points in @entity188 january 27 , 2015 : @entity6 are knocked out of the @entity189 at the semi-final stage after losing 1 - 0 to @entity24 in extra time at @entity81 , with @entity0 unable to inspire a victory			1
february 26 , 2015 : @entity0 misses @entity194 tie with @entity195 through injury and they crash out on penalties in @entity156			0
march 22 , 2015 : any hopes of qualifying for next season 's @entity70 for @entity6 take a huge blow in a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity25 at @entity16			2
@entity0 is left out of the starting @entity204 and comes on as a second half substitute but is sent off just 38 seconds after coming on			0
april 19 , 2015 : @entity6 lose their @entity4 semi-final against @entity12 to end all hopes of a trophy in @entity0 's final season			1
may 10 , 2015 : @entity0 travels with @entity6 to face @entity24 , who could have already wrapped up the title , and faces being ridiculed by the @entity81 crowd			1
: @entity214 may 24 , 2015 : seventeen years playing in the @entity26 end with a trip to face @entity46 at the @entity63 in a game that will likely be of little importance to either side			2
@entity220 along with @entity0 and @entity222 , there 's another member of @entity62 's much - maligned ' golden generation ' who is likely to be leaving the @entity26 in the summer : @entity226			0
the @entity43 defender 's farewell season has fallen flat as he spends much of his time sat on the bench at @entity231 in their relegation battle			0
@entity226 struggled from the start of the season at the centre of the @entity43 defence after moving on from years of loyal service at @entity25			0
the 36 - year - old 's final days in @entity62 's top tier are so chilled , that he showed off his ability to watch @entity242 on his way into training in the back of his car on monday morning			0
@entity226 posted this picture of himself watching television while on the way into training on monday			0

@entity0 's hopes of a trophy ended with @entity6 's @entity4 exit
he was pictured at @entity2 nightclub in @entity3 on sunday evening
@entity6 captain is moving on to @entity258 at the end of the season
he now has a six - game farewell tour of *uninspiring* matches to play
@entity0 will go to champions - elect @entity24 in the midst of a title party
a trip to @entity46 on may 24 will be @entity0 's last game for @entity6
