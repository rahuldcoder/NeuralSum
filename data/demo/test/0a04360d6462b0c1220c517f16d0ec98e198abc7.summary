@entity0 accused @entity2 ’s players of lacking desire after a 3 - 0 defeat at @entity5 put their top four hopes back in the balance			1
the irritation that @entity2 ’s manager felt following the worst day he has experienced in the @entity10 was obvious and he did not attempt to make any excuses for a performance that was toothless and meek from the outset			1
goals from @entity15 , @entity16 and substitute @entity17 did not flatter @entity5 and @entity18 claimed the difference between the two sides came in the attitude and approach they adopted , as @entity2 could not match @entity5 ’s commitment			1
@entity25 and @entity26 look dejected as they wait to kick off after the third goal @entity2 boss @entity0 said that his players could not match @entity5 's motivation @entity31 ( home ) - may 2 @entity33 ( away ) - may 9 @entity34 ( home ) - may 16 @entity36 ( away ) - may 24 @entity18 admitted he was worried after watching @entity2 go through their pre-match warm - up at @entity38 and those fears were shared by his assistants , @entity42 and @entity43 , both of whom expressed their concerns to @entity18 about the squad ’s sharpness			1
‘ when you have a lot of time on the ball , you can lose the ball also easily and then you have to be very sharp in the duels that counts , ’ said @entity18			2
‘ when you see the goal after four minutes , three duels in a row we lost and that is an example			1
‘ this is the first time that i have seen that our motivation , inspiration and aggression was not so high as the opponent and in sport you shall always be compared to your opponent and that was the reason ( we lost )			1
‘ i had already the feeling and my colleagues , @entity74 and @entity43 , had the feeling because the warm up was not so good as usual			2
then you say that in the last minutes before the game , you hope you can recover and stimulate your players but by then it is too late			2
defender @entity80 admitted that @entity2 were second best from the first minute to the last @entity18 fears the defeat has allowed @entity82 to apply pressure to @entity2 in the race for fourth ‘ you have to prepare the match already two or three days before and @entity5 has done that and they have won because of that in the first half we created a lot of chances , five i think , but we never scored			1
when you see the shots on the goal it is also without conviction			2
’ @entity80 said @entity2 were ' second best from first minute until last ' but @entity18 maintained preparations in the build - up had gone smoothly			1
he now recognises @entity82 , who play twice before @entity2 ’s next game , have a real chance to apply pressure in the race for a @entity108 spot			1
‘ the training sessions were all right , ’ said @entity18			2
‘ it is a process because we are playing so well that players think “ ok , it shall come ” – but it shall not come			0
you need inspiration , motivation and aggression to win second balls and fight to the end			2
we ’ve given a light to ( @entity82 )			0
’ two former @entity5 players – @entity122 and @entity25 – both endured wretched afternoons , with @entity18 revealing he substituted @entity122 to prevent him being sent - off , while @entity25 suffered a knee injury that needs assessing			1
two former @entity5 players @entity25 and @entity122 endured wretched afternoons @entity5 manager @entity126 said his side were better in every department than their opponents the home supporters , however , were not concerned about them and instead basked in their best afternoon of the campaign : @entity5 have now taken 16 points from the last 18 available and @entity126 saluted a ‘ complete ’ team performance			1
‘ there has been a big difference after the amount of time we had to cope with the demands of @entity139 and the league , ’ said @entity126			0
‘ by the end of january , we got into the right mentality to cope with both competitions			0
‘ we were not able to get any momentum in the league in the first half of the season			0
our performance today was very similar to our performance against @entity151 in the first half of the season			0
today i hope the players get the credit they deserve			0
it has been a tough season			0
‘ six games ago we had 28 points and we had to win games			0
i do feel we were better in every department of the game			0
we coped with the transition and making the dynamic			0
overall it was a really good game of football			0

@entity0 said @entity2 's motivation did not match @entity5 's
