long before mobile phones came along - allowing single men and women to flirt behind the comfort of a glowing screen - shy love - seekers had to resort to other tactics			1
in the case of late 19th - century @entity9 , it was the ' escort card ' - not to be confused with the explicit sort you might imagine today - but rather a comical printed card men would hand to women they found attractive			1
one was referred to as the ' calling card ' and would be used by gentleman to formally introduce themselves to new acquaintances - much like the modern business card			2
the second , as seen in mr @entity14 ' collection , was a novelty variety reserved for more casual encounters , namely men seeking the company of women , known as an ' escort card '			1
' the device commonly carried a brief message and a simple illustration , ' the encyclopaedia states			0
' flirtatious and fun , the acquaintance card brought levity to what otherwise might have seemed a more formal proposal			2
' a common means of introduction , it was never taken too seriously			0
' @entity60 uncovered the collection , calling them an array of ' amusing pick - up lines you â€™ve not likely heard before while waiting for your drink at the bar '			2
rhyming couplets appeared to have been rather popular in the 19th century according to these cards the card commonly carried a brief message and a simple illustration some were quite specific in their nature - albeit in a very polite way many of them have all the flowery but insincere charm of a cheesy modern - day pick - up line			1
' @entity81 : you are sensible and good , you have all the charms of womanhood , your eyes resemble the stars above you , i shall be miserable if i ca n't love you , ' reads one			0
' may i see you home ? or will i have to set on the fence and watch you meander by ? ' reads another			0
some were a little more down - to - business			0
' i very much desire to make your acquaintance			0
if agreeable , please return this card , appointing time and place for interview , on the other side , ' reads one			2
another even blunter card bears the question : ' i am _ who the devil are you ? ' several of the cards bear phrases such as : ' may i have the pleasure of seeing you home this evening ? if so , keep this card ; if not , please return			1
' @entity107 , if nothing else			0
certain cards were short and to - the - point - including this ' may @entity111 ? ' card these ' escort cards ' were seen as a more casual version of what we today regard as business cards this blank card poses , ' who the devil are you ? ' this man 's intent is made crystal clear by its very title many of the cards have all the flowery but insincere charm of a cheesy modern - day pick - up line ' two souls with but a single thought ; two hearts that beat as one ' , reads this one this card addresses its recipient as a ' dear creature ' many carried the disclaimer , ' if so , keep this card , if not , please return it '			1

the cheeky cards were given by men to women in 19th century @entity9
some were *romantic* in tone , others more blunt - but they were always very polite
many men would ask for the card back in return if they were *rejected*
