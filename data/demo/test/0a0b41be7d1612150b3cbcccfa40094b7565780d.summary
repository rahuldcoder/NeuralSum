@entity0 and @entity1 have again been reminded of their responsibilities to @entity4 after the team were forced to tackle head on the tension that rose between them in @entity9 on sunday			1
@entity4 motorsport boss @entity10 is confident the matter has been laid to rest after @entity1 bemoaned @entity0 's ' selfish ' tactics following their one - two finish at the @entity14			1
@entity0 was absolved of any blame by both @entity10 and @entity4 non-executive chairman @entity16 , although the problem did at least provide another scenario from which to learn			1
@entity0 celebrates on the podium after winning the @entity20 on sunday @entity0 led home @entity4 team - mate @entity1 in @entity14 to retain his lead in the championship with the next race in @entity25 following up swiftly on sunday , @entity10 said : ' we saw tensions between @entity1 and @entity0 in the race and we tackled them directly on sunday night to stop anything carrying over to this weekend			1
' when you have intense competition it 's normal it causes emotions to run high - and that 's not something we want to change			0
' both drivers are now very focused on delivering maximum performance in @entity25 and our package should cope well with the demands of the circuit			0
' we maintain our philosophy of letting the drivers race , but they both know the no 1 priority for the team is to win for @entity46			0
' for @entity1 , in particular , the race offers an opportunity for swift retribution as the 29 - year - old has so far been trounced this season by @entity0 , who has finished ahead on the grid after qualifying and in all three races to date			2
@entity0 , who has out - qualified and finished ahead of @entity1 at every race , sprays a grid girl with champagne ' @entity9 was a frustrating weekend for me and i 'm glad we have another race right away to get straight back to work , ' said @entity1			1
' the team has made a great start to the season , and with this incredible car they have built i know i just need to find a little bit more in myself to get back to the top step			0
' i 've never won in @entity25 but i 've taken the last two pole positions here and also set the fastest lap at this circuit on my @entity73 debut , so i know i have the pace			2
' @entity1 accused @entity0 of being ' selfish ' as tension rose between the two @entity4 team - mates in @entity9 last year 's intense battle between @entity0 and @entity1 was one of the highlights of the season , and lit the blue touchpaper to their rivalry as it was later discovered the latter attacked @entity0 by using a different engine setting			1
@entity1 is now eager to finally get one over on @entity85 , adding : " of course , everyone remembers the race last year and it would be great for the fans if we can put on another great show for them this time			2
' if we can do that , but with the two top steps in a different order , it would be fantastic			0
' it wo n't be so easy with the competition ( in @entity97 ) breathing down our necks			0
' but that makes for even more exciting racing , so i 'm looking forward to a great battle and i 'm determined to come out on top			0
