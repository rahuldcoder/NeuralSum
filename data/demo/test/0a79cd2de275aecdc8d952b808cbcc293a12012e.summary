the residence : inside the private world of the @entity2 by @entity3 for @entity5 , the @entity2 is as iconic and royal a palace as you can get			1
for non-americans , it is a respected power symbol , but not one to be especially loved			1
@entity11 , an @entity5 journalist assigned to cover the @entity12 @entity2 , became intrigued by the workings of the mansion after watching @entity15 set about interviewing the staff , who number at least 100 , to build up a comparable picture of the @entity5 version of @entity20			1
the staff all live out in @entity22 and commute in			1
those on duty can not go home until the president retires and goes to bed			1
so they see little of their families and are often divorced as a result			1
the pay is not great , but the job is prestigious and passed by personal recommendation among friends			1
most of them have stayed there for 20 years or more			1
@entity41 ( pictured with his wife , @entity42 ) , on the other hand , was over-chummy , so eager to talk to them that servants actually tried to dodge him in order not to get caught for hours the west wing is the president ’s office quarters ; the @entity49 belongs to the @entity50 and her office staff			1
‘ @entity58 ’ , as the living quarters are called , really begins on the second floor and is kept hidden from the hundreds of tourists who parade through the state rooms every afternoon			1
keeping the organisation running smoothly , from the workshops in the basement to the snipers on the roof , is a complex operation			1
it costs money — $ 13 million a year from government funds , plus a hefty contribution from the @entity69 itself			1
presidents and their wives have to pay for their own food and drink and that of their personal guests			1
they are also charged for dry - cleaning			1
even well - heeled @entity78 are always appealing to keep the bills down , especially in the kitchens where top chefs are above such considerations as cost			1
@entity84 was heard to complain : ‘ we have n’t nearly as much money as you read in the papers ’ ; while the @entity85 even asked the kitchen to serve them leftovers for their personal meals			2
the @entity2 is never untenanted			1
the changeover of president takes place at 12 noon on @entity95			2
between then and 5pm , the entire moving out and in of the two families and their respective belongings has to be completed			2
the staff include ushers , chefs , maids , doormen , engineers , plumbers , full - time florists ( the flower bill is enormous ) , even calligraphers who are kept busy writing invitations in fine script			1
but the glory of the place is its corps of butlers — six of them full - time , plus dozens more called in for big receptions , parties and dinners			2
even well - heeled @entity78 are always appealing to keep the bills down , @entity84 ( pictured with her @entity120 ) was heard to complain : ‘ we have n’t nearly as much money as you read in the papers ’ most , by tradition , are black			2
there is a picture of ten of them taking a break between courses in their black ties			2
what is the collective noun for such a fine body of men ? a bevy of butlers ? the @entity139 and the @entity140 liked staying up late and entertaining until 2am , which meant that those on duty did n’t get home until much later than that			2
this did n’t go down well			2
oddly enough , the best - liked couple were the older @entity148 — @entity149 and his wife , @entity150 , who were used to having plenty of servants and were relaxed and genuinely concerned about them			2
the black staff , especially the elderly butlers who remembered segregation , are especially proud to serve the @entity156 as the first black presidential family			1
one found @entity12 and his wife , @entity159 , celebrating gaining the @entity2 on their first night there with an impromptu dance to a record by @entity163			1
and yet the @entity156 have turned out to be rather reserved and distant with the staff — even , says one , ‘ stand - offish ’			1
@entity41 , on the other hand , was over-chummy , so eager to talk to them that servants actually tried to dodge him in order not to get caught for hours			2
he had a disconcerting habit of sitting around naked reading the newspapers			2
his wife , @entity172 , by contrast , was a martinet who collected @entity175			2
woe betide anyone who broke a piece			2
she would call a servant to say that the lights needed turning on when the switch was within easy reach			0
when she was going to be difficult about the meal service , which was frequently , she would send for the chef , cock her head on one side and smile — and then find fault , usually with the desserts served by chef @entity190			0
unlike some presidential couples , the @entity140 ( pictured ) used to share a bedroom — until the @entity194 scandal - when @entity195 was relegated to the sofa in the study for a matter of time once , she decided at the last moment that the dessert for a state dinner should be sugar baskets each containing three sugar tulips			0
chef @entity190 objected : ‘ but there are only two days left until the dinner ! ’ she cocked her head : ‘ @entity190 , you have two days and two nights before the dinner			0
’ @entity211 installed a bowling alley in the basement			0
he used to wander into the kitchens for a chat and discovered a washer - up who was also a keen bowler			0
they went on playing until 2am			0
@entity211 then wrote a note to the man ’s wife to explain why he was so late home			0
the @entity223 made news by appointing a convicted murderess as nanny to their daughter , @entity227			0
@entity228 was convinced she was innocent , and the first family ’s confidence was justified when the verdict was reversed			0
unlike some presidential couples , the @entity140 used to share a bedroom — until the @entity194 scandal reached its height in 1998			0
for three or four months , @entity236 made @entity195 sleep on a sofa in a study attached to the bedroom			0
most women on the staff thought he ’d got what he deserved			1
the feuding @entity140 were the talk of the staff , who overheard their bad language and the sound of objects being thrown in bedrooms			1
@entity236 ’s voice screaming ‘ @entity254 bastard ! ’ was followed by a heavy thud			0
much blood was discovered all over the bed			0
no one believed that her husband , who needed several stitches , had walked into a bathroom door in the dark , as he explained			0
‘ we ’re pretty sure she clocked him with a book , ’ said one member of staff			1
there were certainly plenty to hand — there were at least 20 on the @entity140 ’ bedside tables , including the @entity274			0
but the biggest disturber of the peace was the huge bully from @entity278 , @entity279 , who succeeded the assassinated @entity120			0
he gloried in his size ( 6 ft 3 in ) and his achievements			0
he had tv sets installed everywhere and kept several on loudly as he watched himself in the newscasts			0
he undressed in front of the staff and gave them instructions while sitting on the lavatory , whose seat had to be replaced with a bigger one when he broke it			1
he drove the plumbers to nervous breakdowns over his shower			0
it was never hot enough nor strong enough for him			0
they replaced one after the other until the water came out as if from a fire hose and the heat generated set off the fire alarm			0
one water jet had to be aimed precisely at his penis ( which he called ‘ @entity307 ’ ) and another up his rear end			0
he raged at the plumbers until he got satisfaction			0
such was the man who escalated the @entity312 .			0

for non-americans the @entity2 it is a respected power symbol
