@entity7 , 29 , visited the @entity8 on @entity9 , @entity10 , with her daughter , @entity12 , and her daughter 's friend			1
after ordering a non-alcoholic @entity17 ' mocktail ' for the girls , ms @entity15 was disgusted when she heard that her daughter had actually been drinking an alcoholic version			2
the menu : @entity7 , 29 , holds up the ' mocktails ' list she ordered drinks from for daughter @entity12 at the @entity8 in @entity10			1
restaurant staff accidentally served the girl a drink with alcohol in it restaurant bosses admitted to making the mistake but blamed the incident on ms @entity7 for leaving her daughter alone while she went for a cigarette			1
ms @entity7 , from @entity33 , said : ' it is unbelievable			1
' how dare they blame it on me			0
it makes me out to be a bad mother but they made the mistake			2
' explaining what happened , she added : ' i ordered my daughter and her friend @entity47 , and a bit later me and my friend decided to go for a cigarette			1
' i went to the counter to ask for two more sweet kisses to be taken over to them , then went downstairs for a cigarette			0
when i came back up my daughter just blurted out saying " mum , i 've had alcohol "			1
' dining out : inside the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10			2
the restaurant admitted to the mishap but blamed ms @entity7 for leaving her daughter and a friend unattended and going outside for a cigarette ms @entity7 , who works at a @entity63 's restaurant , was horrified to learn that instead of @entity47 , staff at the @entity8 had placed two @entity66 cocktails in front of the girls while the adults were away from the table			1
she said : ' i took a big swig of the drink and thought , wow these have alcohol in them			0
i was baffled why there was n't a manager out to explain what had happened			0
' the order had been mistaken for a non-alcoholic @entity80 , but accidentally made as a normal @entity80 with vodka			0
the unhappy mother , who said she tries to shelter @entity12 from anything too adult for her age , also thinks mocktail menus should not be alluding to anything sexual			0
poor service : ms @entity15 with her receipt from the @entity8 , which shows the two @entity80 cocktails she ordered after visiting the restaurant the @entity8 said : ' we did serve something wrong , however putting it into context the issue was the lady went outside for a cigarette and left the children unattended			1
we were quite bothered by that ' ' i would n't even let @entity12 look at the menu because it said @entity107 , and a @entity108 , and i do n't want her reading that stuff , ' she said			0
' i do n't even want her thinking about that kind of stuff			0
' i told the manager that at the end of the day the mocktail menu is non-alcoholic so you are mainly aiming at children , but was told that was n't necessarily the case			2
' a spokesman for @entity8 said : ' we did serve something wrong , however putting it into context the issue was the lady went outside for a cigarette and left the children unattended			2
' we were quite bothered by that as it 's quite unusual to leave two small children out of sight			0
this was an accident and there was some confusion with the order , but there is a responsibility for parents to stay with their children			0

@entity7 , 29 , left *speechless* when daughter told her what happened
the mother , from @entity33 , had ordered ' mocktails ' for the girl and her friend
went outside for a cigarette and was told ' mum , i 've had alcohol ' on return
@entity10 restaurant blamed ms @entity7 for leaving children on their own
