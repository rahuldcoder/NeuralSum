@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 insists he has not lost any sleep over his high - profile errors of recent weeks			1
the @entity4 was exceptional for the @entity5 in their win over @entity7 on sunday			1
it was a far cry from his displays in @entity1 's previous two matches , however			1
@entity11 ( centre ) was in phenomenal form as @entity1 beat rivals @entity7 on sunday @entity0 ( centre ) has struggled in previous weeks and his error led to a goal for @entity18 on march 22 @entity0 cut a despondent man against @entity18 ( left ) but was back on form against @entity7 on @entity21 his poor touch allowed @entity23 to score in @entity1 's 3 - 2 win over @entity18 on march 22 before @entity26 's @entity25 beat him from 66 yards last weekend			1
but @entity0 says his confidence levels have not waned as a result			0
' i never doubted that i ca n't catch the ball			0
against @entity18 , i just tried to make the best solution , ' he said			1
' it was not the best control , but in the second half i showed that i am mentally strong and i saved the team			0
' against @entity26 , if you want to play high as a team , you as a goalkeeper have to play high as a team as well			2
@entity25 did a good strike and that can happen			0
' but i showed against @entity7 that if you play high , you can go get the ball from the midfield			2
if i 'm on the 16 yard box , i can go get it there			0
for me it 's not a problem			0
@entity0 has also faced criticism for failing to keep out @entity25 's 66 - yard strike against @entity26 @entity0 ( right ) said he never doubted himself during his indifferent spell of form for @entity1 ' i continue			1
i helped the team with two good saves against @entity7 and i 'm happy			2
' the most important thing is the team and against @entity18 and @entity26 we still won			1
' i 'm 22 and still learning			0
these were moments which i could learn from			0
