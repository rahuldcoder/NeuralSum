another day at @entity0 , another awkward conversation with @entity2 for @entity3			1
this time , rather than a chat about a contract spurned it will be a noxious but legal substance once tried and tested by our own @entity7 that will be under discussion			0
if @entity3 has any sense , he wo n’t use the distinguished list of those who have previously tried nitrous oxide as an attempt at mitigation			1
once again the 20 - year - old @entity18 forward has been rather stupid			1
for @entity3 the life lessons are arriving thick and fast			2
what will perhaps stand rather more impressively in his favour is some of the @entity23 produced in this rather important win for @entity18			2
@entity3 wheels away in celebration after scoring @entity18 's opener in the first half at @entity29 @entity18 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity30 7 ; @entity31 6 , @entity32 5 , can 6.5 , @entity33 6 ; @entity34 7 , @entity35 6.5 , @entity36 7 ; @entity37 6 ( @entity38 58 , 6 ) , @entity39 7.5 , @entity3 7 ( @entity40 89 )			1
subs not used : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46			0
goals : @entity3 9 , @entity35 71			1
booked : @entity31 , @entity33			0
@entity48 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity49 7 ; @entity50 6 , @entity51 5.5 , @entity52 6 , @entity53 6 ; @entity54 5.5 ( @entity55 67 , 6 ) , @entity56 6.5 , @entity57 6 , @entity58 6.5 ( @entity59 , 75 ) ; @entity60 6 ; @entity61 6.5 ( @entity62 86 )			1
subs not used : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67			0
ratings by @entity73 at @entity29 @entity3 cuts in from the left to score			1
click here for more from @entity77 there was a moment , just before the hour , when @entity3 actually contributed one of the misses of the season			2
it was one of those he would probably have struggled to do again if he tried			0
much earlier in the piece , however , when his team were desperate for a good start , @entity3 scored the kind of goal that few can score			1
it is this that motivates @entity2 as he tries to navigate a way through the current difficulties of the contract negotiations			0
it is this , and other moments like it , that convince managers like @entity2 that players like @entity3 are worth the trouble			2
for be assured , this was an important win for @entity18 and an important performance			2
@entity48 may be among the @entity106 ’s most compliant current opposition but @entity18 ’s own football has been patchy recently			1
they have an @entity110 semi-final on sunday and needed victory here to bring momentum and to take them to within four points of @entity116 , the team now occupying the final @entity118 position			1
when the stakes are high , then , you need your best players and here , after some modest recent form of his own , @entity3 pitched in early and emphatically			2
both sets of players stand for a minute 's silence to remember the 96 @entity18 fans who died in 1989 the minute 's silence was impeccably observed by both sets of fans before the match captain @entity34 supplied the ammunition with a crossfield pass struck arrow straight to his team - mate over 40 yards			1
@entity3 ’s first touch was perfect but then we expect that in the @entity106 these days			2
what followed was even better , though , as he eased inside @entity50 and @entity51 before striking a perfect right - foot shot to @entity49 ’s left with his instep			0
@entity3 was in total control of events from the moment @entity34 ’s pass arrived and it was terrific to watch			0
with centre forward @entity142 injured again , @entity3 once again was crucial to his team ’s attacking play			0
this time he was stationed on the left of a front three that featured @entity37 on the right and @entity39 through the middle			0
for a while — for about 30 minutes — @entity18 were excellent and @entity48 struggled to cope			1
@entity39 was his team ’s best player , as he was all night , and he could have scored twice while @entity3 brought a low save from @entity49 from an angle , as indeed did left back @entity33			2
the key to it was that @entity18 were playing football that was relaxed and for that they owed much to @entity3 ’s goal			1
they should have scored at least one more — maybe two — during this period of dominance			0
@entity39 was a menace while at the base of the midfield formation @entity36 was playing well enough to make @entity164 fret over the team selection when he is freed from suspension at @entity167 this weekend			0
@entity3 curls the ball in to the far corner of @entity49 's net to give @entity18 the lead @entity3 's shot nestles in to the back of the net as a hapless @entity49 picks himself up from the @entity29 turf @entity48 's defence begin their inquest @entity36 runs over to celebrate with the @entity179 man @entity18 players celebrate in unison as they looked to close the gap on @entity116 when goals do n’t arrive , though , things can go wrong and , for 10 minutes either side of half - time , that suddenly looked as though it might happen here			1
in the 10 minutes before the break @entity48 should have had a penalty when the dreadful @entity32 tripped @entity61 , while the @entity48 forward brought a superb save from @entity30			1
midfielder @entity58 also threatened twice from 18 yards			0
into the second half and , briefly , this surprising pattern continued			0
lovren almost disabled his own team - mate @entity193 by standing on his foot and then slashed wildly at a clearance			0
@entity30 , meanwhile , punched a corner clear under pressure and was happy to see a low drive from @entity58 hacked clear by a defender			0
@entity32 , who was lucky not to give away a penalty , challenges @entity48 forward @entity61 @entity18 captain @entity164 ( centre ) , suspended for the match , watches on from the stands @entity32 clears the ball with his head as @entity36 and @entity61 also scrap for the ball @entity3 inexplicably skews his shot wide in the second half when it looked easier to score @entity3 ca n't believe he has missed as @entity49 gets up to gather the ball for the restart @entity3 shakes hands with manager @entity2 after he was substituted for @entity38 in the second half at this point the game , despite early indications , was in the balance and it was then that @entity3 fluffed his lines when handed the chance to settle it			1
happily for him , @entity35 did manage to convert the vital second goal not long after			2
@entity3 ’s miss really was spectacular			0
another raking cross from @entity34 was miscued by @entity50 in front of his own goal and when the ball broke for @entity3 on the six - yard line it seemed he could n’t miss. remarkably he did and , on another night , @entity49 may have been tempted to offer him a high five in the tunnel			1
as it was , @entity35 ’s subsequent goal was timely			2
@entity48 failed to clear a corner properly with 20 minutes left and when @entity35 ’s weak header came back to him off @entity50 the @entity231 hooked the loose ball high into the corner of the net			1
@entity35 watches as his second - half effort beats @entity49 to double @entity18 's lead and earn them some breathing space @entity35 is mobbed by his team - mates after securing three points for @entity18 that closed the gap on @entity116 with the result settled there was still time for @entity48 ’s @entity60 to get himself sent off			1
riled by a spat with @entity31 , @entity60 clattered into @entity36 and received a second yellow card			0
in truth , he was lucky it was not a straight red and , as club captain , he will doubtless face a few harsh words from his manager on tuesday morning			0
it appears that @entity3 , in that regard , will not be alone			0
@entity60 lunges in on @entity36 with an ugly late challenge to earn a second yellow card @entity31 confronts @entity60 after the challenge which many thought should have resulted in a straight red @entity60 is already on his way as referee @entity69 shows him a red card			1

@entity261 leaked of @entity3 *inhaling* nitrous oxide just a day after he was pictured *smoking* *shisha*
@entity3 put @entity18 1 - 0 up after just nine minutes at @entity29 before missing easy chance in second half
referee @entity69 missed what pundit @entity268 described as a ' *blatant* penalty ' for @entity48 's @entity61
@entity271 midfielder @entity35 then scored his first goal at @entity29 to put @entity18 2 - 0 up after 70 minutes
@entity274 midfielder @entity60 sent off late on for two bookable *offences*
result moves @entity18 up to within four points of @entity116 in fourth and is @entity48 's fifth defeat in a row
