' it 's not so good for @entity8 that he is leaving but hopefully one day he will manage abroad			1
i think his passion would fit and to see him in @entity6 would be very interesting			0
' everyone has their philosophy and i think @entity2 has proved that he 's top - level and can teach a lot			1
' however , @entity0 insisted @entity2 , whose side are 10th in the @entity38 table , will need time to decide on his future after a largely successful spell in @entity8 which has brought two league titles and a @entity44 final appearance			1
he said : ' i think he should just finish the season with @entity8 and then he should be given time			1
' we 'll see what he does next , but i think he 's fought his way out of all situations and i think that this time he will find a path that gives him a new challenge			0
' but firstly , i wish him all the best and time to think about his achievements			0
sometimes you can underestimate what it 's like going straight into a new job			0
i think you should give him time - and i wish him all the best			2

he said : ' it is obviously sad news for @entity8 , [ he was ] such a passionate successful and passionate manager for them			2
he was the guy who turned it around at @entity8			2
' the whole situation there - he built the squad on young players and they improved so much in the seven years he was in charge			2
it is a sad situation			0
' but in the summer , it will be a new situation for him			0
maybe he is going to go abroad and see how it goes there			0
' i would love to see more @entity28 managers abroad , because it is obviously a new challenge , to adapt to the culture , the language , the system			2
yes , why not ? ' it is his decision			0
he worked really hard and pushed really hard , so even if he said he is not tired , maybe he takes a bit of breather to fuel his energy and his batteries ?
