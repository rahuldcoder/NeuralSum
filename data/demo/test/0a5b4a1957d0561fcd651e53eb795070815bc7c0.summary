hundreds of thousands of football fans are facing travel misery this weekend because of the @entity3 rail shut down			2
despite more than 30 @entity7 and @entity8 games scheduled for the long weekend , large parts of the rail network are set to be closed for repair works			1
more than half the games are set to be affected by delays and disruption , forcing fans onto the roads			1
this weekend 's crunch @entity7 fixture , @entity16 versus @entity17 in @entity18 , will be hit by the rail chaos @entity20 has accused the government of failing to learn from the @entity23 chaos , when nearly a million football fans faced nightmare journeys to follow their team			1
ministers were warned of the potential problems in advance @entity20 has claimed – but they failed to scrutinise the planned level of maintenance work			1
every single major artery on @entity34 's railways was shut down			0
no trains ran between @entity36 and @entity37 or @entity38 on the @entity39 , @entity40 or @entity42 mainlines			0
the @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 were also shut			0
despite the chaos the government has refused to step in this weekend to stop large parts of the rail network shutting down again			1
the planned engineering works over the @entity3 weekend will hit all routes to and from @entity52 – hitting the busy west coast services between the capital and @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity17			1
there will be no mainline trains at all from @entity59 out towards @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 and further disruptions on lines from @entity65			0
all trains out of @entity52 - serving the main west coast rail line between the capital and @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity17 - have been hit trains between @entity69 and @entity70 are also affected as well as those traveling on the line between @entity59 and @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
all routes to and from @entity80 are also hit , with @entity82 trains to @entity83 and routes to @entity45 from @entity85 also affected			1
it means there will no trains for fans wanting to travel to the @entity80 versus @entity91 match in @entity92 – forcing supporters onto the roads on replacement bus services instead			0
there will also be no trains available for the thousands of @entity17 fans wanting to get home after the @entity16 versus @entity17 match on saturday			0
@entity101 , the @entity102 , said accused ministers or being too ' out of touch ' with ordinary football fans to understand the chaos the rail shutdown will cause			2
@entity108 transport minister @entity101 said the government had not learned from past mistakes he said : ' just like on @entity23 , hundreds of thousands of people will want to travel to see family and also to follow their football team on one of the busiest fixture lists of the season			2
' ministers were asleep on the job over the @entity120 period and there is little to suggest they have learnt from their mistakes			2
' we have seen no evidence that ministers have adequately scrutinised the level of planned engineering works or ensured that the necessary contingency plans are in place			1
' as usual , it will be hard - pressed passengers - who 've already seen their fares go up by more than 20 per cent on average since 2010 - who will suffer			0
' transport secretary @entity133 has admitted there will be ' frustrations ' on rail services this weekend and urged people to ' think twice ' before travelling			0
mr @entity133 said : ' there will be alternatives and we 've lifted almost all motorway roadworks to help			0
' but if you are travelling between friday and monday night please check your journey first , it may be that you 'll think twice about how you travel			0
' i 'm sorry if it is more difficult - but my promise is that the work is essential and when it 's done the benefits will be worthwhile			0
' a spokesman for @entity151 said over the past three months they have contacted both the @entity153 and every individual @entity7 club to ensure they ’re aware about the disruption			1
a @entity157 spokesman said the @entity3 weekend was a ' sensible ' time to carry out the repair work			0
he said : ' thanks to this government 's successful management of our economy we have been able to commit £ 38billion to upgrading our national rail infrastructure , after 13 years of @entity20 neglect			2
' the £ 100million of upgrades this @entity3 is the biggest set of works ever carried out over a long weekend			1
with passenger numbers down 40 per cent it is a sensible time to do these works , they will unblock current bottlenecks and deliver a better railway for passengers			0
' @entity20 need to get real , they can either support the long overdue upgrade of our national rail network or plunge it back into long term decline			2
' on the 7th of may voters will have a clear choice between the @entity157 securing our country 's long term future or a @entity20 that will bring chaos			1
