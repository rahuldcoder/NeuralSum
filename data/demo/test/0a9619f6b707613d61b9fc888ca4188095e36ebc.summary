a mutilated fox : hardly the most glamorous prop @entity2 has ever posed with , but in this case , that is precisely the point			1
the former made in @entity6 star has joined forces with animal rights crusaders @entity8 on a hard - hitting anti-fur campaign directed at @entity11 after the national department store abandoned its ten - year anti-fur policy			1
' @entity11 : here 's the @entity14 , ' the slogan reads , alongside an image of the 26 - year - old animal lover , who is brandishing what appears to be a skinned fox - a fake one we 've been assured			1
' i love animals , ' @entity2 told @entity35			2
' having educated myself about the fur industry , it breaks my heart to think people allow such cruelty to continue by buying fur products			0
' @entity11 , which has 12 locations around the world and previously stood against the fur industry , backtracked last year when it quietly re-introduced it			1
@entity48 between £ 300 and £ 1,500 , the department store 's current range includes coyote fur courtesy of @entity50 , raccoon fur from @entity52 and plenty of rabbit pelts from @entity55			0
' when i see people i know wearing fur , i will initiate the conversation by asking them if it 's real or not			0
if they confirm that it 's real , i express disgust , ' @entity2 said , ' if they are interested , then i will tell them more about this cruel industry			2
i just want people to make informed decisions with their purchases			0
anti-fur : ' i love animals , ' miss @entity2 , pictured , tells @entity35			1
' having educated myself about the fur industry , it breaks my heart to think people allow such cruelty to continue by buying fur products ' @entity77 : miss @entity2 , pictured in @entity78 this week , leads a mostly vegan lifestyle and shops at fur - free stores including @entity78 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 ' if they know about the industry and still choose to wear fur , then that 's fine - although i ca n't personally understand how they could do that			1
' but i think a lot of people prefer to live in ignorance , and that 's really frustrating			0
' in a statement to @entity35 , @entity11 said : ' [ we are ] committed to sustainable and responsible practice across all areas of [ our ] business , and ethical trading is an important part of this programme			2
' we only source products from reputable brands , which includes seeking the assurance that the fur they use in products has been sourced responsibly			0
' however , in a recent exposé fronted by @entity111 , @entity8 went undercover on ' @entity113 ' fur farms , a label which is meant to give fur - stocking stores assurances about the animal welfare and conditions in which animals are bred and slaughtered			1
it found raccoons , rabbits and minks kept in filthy wire cages , sometimes alongside the rotting corpses of other animals			0
' these animals were left to suffer from untreated injuries , including missing limbs , ' @entity8 reports			2
' frightened and distressed , they often mutilate themselves and others in the cage , only to be slaughtered in the name of fashion			0
' party line : in a statement , @entity11 said , ' we only source products from reputable brands , which includes seeking the assurance that the fur they use in products has been sourced responsibly ' put a name to the face : @entity48 between £ 300 and £ 1,500 , @entity11 ' current designer range includes fur from coyotes ( left ) , raccoons ( center ) and foxes ( right ) when @entity35 asked reps at @entity11 to clarify their position on exactly what made them change their minds on their anti-fur policy , communication ceased and they declined to make any further comment			1
@entity8 's foundation director @entity158 points out : ' all fur is the product of a bloody , violent industry			1
we encourage consumers not to be deceived by @entity11 ' claims of selling ' humanely and ethically ' obtained furs			2
' before @entity2 knew anything about the industry , she admits she owned a rabbit fur coat			2
' @entity170 to say i do n't any more , ' she said			0
' i gave it to a @entity174 charity called @entity175 , which use donated furs to keep rescued dogs warm in winter			0
' cruelty - free : miss @entity2 is a particular fan of designer @entity178 , who has been a lifelong vegetarian and refuses to even use leather in her collections			1

@entity11 is not the only entity , or person , to have broken its anti-fur promise			2
